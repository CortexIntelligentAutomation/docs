### Features

#### Capability

##### Support for creating new process from Natural Language

Within [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway], the user can now create a new process from `Natural Language`.
This feature allows the user to create a new process by entering a description of the process in natural language. The system will then generate a new process using `OpenAi` based on the description provided.

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
The generation of processes from `Natural Language` require subscription to the OpenAI API.
The `OpenAiKey` and `OpenAiModel` must be configured within [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway] `web.cfg`, and are encryptable, however there is currently no documentation available on how to do this. For further assistance, please raise a case in the [{{% ctx %}} Service Portal][].

#### Security

##### Configurable Global RunAs User for flows

The [{{% ctx %}} Execution][{{% ctx %}} Execution Service] now supports a configurable Global RunAs User for flows. This allows the user to configure a RunAs user that all flows will run as, rather than using the Network Service.  
RunAs user can be overwritten on a per block basis using the advanced `Run As` block property.

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
The `RunAsCredentials` must be configured within [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][] `appsettings.json`, where the `UserName` must be encrypted, and `Password` and `Domain` are encryptable, however there is currently no documentation available on how to do this. For further assistance, please raise a case in the [{{% ctx %}} Service Portal][].
