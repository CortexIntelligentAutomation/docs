### Features

#### Capability

##### Introduced support for Multi-Factor Authentication on {{% ctx %}} Gateway

Within [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway], Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) support has been introduced, adding support for OpenID Connection (MFA via Identity Providers).  

A new `Authentication` admin page, replacing the `LDAP Connection` admin page, has been introduced.  
It includes the following features:

* edit of an existing LDAP Connection
* add, and edit and removal of OpenID Connect providers

The existing `LDAP Authorisation` has been renamed to`Authorisation`, reflecting that both `LDAP` and `OpenID Connection` providers can now be configured.  

Once an OpenID Connect provider is configured, users will be able to log-in to {{% ctx %}} Gateway using the new OpenID Connect Provider, or use LDAP as before.

##### Introduced suggestion of next blocks in Flow Editor

Within the [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway] [Flow Editor][], support for suggesting the next blocks to add to a Flow has been introduced.  

When selecting a block, arrows are now shown on each port of the block. Clicking on an arrow opens a filtered palette as a pop-up menu with suggested blocks that can be added to the Flow. Clicking on a block in the menu adds the block to the Flow, connects it to the selected port and correctly positions it, shifting any already connected blocks if needed.

Notable features for this release include:

* display of arrows next to the ports of the selected block
* filtering the block palette to only show blocks that can be connected to the selected port
* insertion of the block if the port is already connected
* proper alignment and spacing of the added block
* expansion of the [workspace canvas][] if the added block is outside the current view

##### Introduced support for debugging of production Flows

Within the [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway] [Packages][] page, support for debugging of production Flows has been introduced.

When viewing the [Packages][] [Running executions grid][], users can now attach to a running Flow execution. This opens the Flow in the Flow Editor in debug mode.

Notable features include the ability to:

* see who is attached to a running Flow execution
* attach and detach from running Flow executions
* open the right Flow version for the selected [Package][] when attaching
* perform all debugging features while attached to a running Flow execution
* show an error if attach or detach fails

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
Any changes made while debugging a production Flow are transient, and will not be saved to the underlying Flow [Package][].

#### Security

##### Added Authentication Management to {{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service

The [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][] now includes authentication management capabilities including but not limited to:

* Authorisation management
* Token management

##### Support for single use of refresh tokens

The [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][] has been updated to support single use of refresh tokens when used to refresh access.  

It is now possible to configure the following:

* Access Token Lifetime
* Refresh Token Lifetime
* Refresh Token Reuse Leeway
* Minimum Pruning Token Lifetime
* Enable Token Entry Validation
* Enable Data Protection
* Use Reference Tokens
* Enable Degraded Mode

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
By default, the refresh token behaviour will be unchanged and refresh tokens can be used multiple times to refresh access tokens. This can be configured, however there is currently no documentation available on how to do this.  
For further assistance, please raise a case in the {{< ahref path="Cortex.ServicePortal.MainDoc" version="2025.3" title="{{% ctx %}} Service Portal" >}}.

#### Performance

##### Improved performance of Execution Management Service

The [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][] has been optimised to improve performance by batching of execution started/ended messages.

##### Improved performance of Execution Service

The [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][] has been optimised to improve performance by adding semaphores to regulate asynchronous cache access, as well as further optimisations on hot code paths.

#### Scalability

##### Improved RabbitMQ Node Resilience for Service Fabric

The {{% ctx %}} platform now allows [Service Fabric][] services to continue operating if a RabbitMQ node of a primary replica goes down, ensuring the primary replica remains functional.

#### Observability

##### Expanded Block Logging

The block logging capabilities have been expanded to include additional blocks, providing enhanced observability into Flow executions.

The `Event` section now includes the following:

* Details
  * Exception: the exception when a block errors
  * GatewayUrl: the path to append to the Gateway URL to take you to the block the log is referring to.
* Tags
  * Cortex
    * Block.Result.Status: the status of the block execution (e.g., Succeeded, Errored)
    * Exception.Type: the plain text name of the exception thrown, if any

##### Exposed API Block logs in Grafana

The API Block logs have been exposed in Grafana, allowing for improved monitoring and analysis flow executions.

#### Installation

##### Optimised OpenSSL Certificate generation

The OpenSSL certificate generation process has been optimised by generating the certificate locally, then copying it to the target server, avoiding the use of PowerShell Remoting.

<!--	37935	 - 	Product Backlog Item	 - 	Installation - OpenSSL issue when used over PSRemoting - HotFix 2025.3-HotFix.25351 into 2025.9	 - 	2025.9; Refined: 1	 - 	Cortex\2025 Q4 S3	-->

#### Upgrade

##### Changed location of CertificateSettings for Service Fabric services

The `CertificateSettings` has been moved away from the `Settings.xml` to the `appsettings.json` file for the following services:

* [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Listeners Service][]

This prevents the need to update the `version` number of the `ConfigPackage` when changing the certificate subject name within the `ServiceManifest`.

### Bug Fixes

#### Capability

##### Running Executions not backwards compatible

A bug has been fixed where running executions were not compatible when an older version of the [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][] was running alongside a newer version of the [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][].

##### Block package not found

A bug has been fixed where the [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][] would not find the blocks package, and would not retry.  
The service now watches for changes on the blocks package folder, then retries accordingly.
