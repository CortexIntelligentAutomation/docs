### Features

#### Capability

##### Added multi‑factor authentication (MFA) via OpenID Connect on {{% ctx %}} Gateway

Within [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway], administrators can now configure one or more `OpenID Connect` identity providers to enable MFA-backed sign‑in.  

A new `Authentication` admin page (replacing `LDAP Connection`) centralises `Authentication` setup, allowing you to:

* edit of an existing `LDAP` connection
* add, edit, and remove `OpenID Connect` providers

The existing `LDAP Authorisation` has been renamed to`Authorisation` to reflect that both `LDAP` and `OpenID Connect` providers can be configured.  

Once an `OpenID Connect` provider is configured, users may authenticate with either the new provider or continue using `LDAP`.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

<!-- Security - Support MFA - OpenIDLogins scriptsController cache invalidation on provider change -->

##### Added next blocks suggestion to the Flow Editor

Within the [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway] [Flow Editor][User Guide - Flow Editor], next blocks suggestion to add to a flow has been introduced.  

When a block is selected, arrows are now shown on each port of the block.  
Clicking an arrow opens the palettes in a pop‑up filtered to blocks that can be validly connected. Selecting a block:

* adds the block to the flow
* connects it to the selected port and positions it correctly
* shifts already connected blocks where necessary, expanding the [workspace][] canvas when placement falls outside the current view

##### Enabled debugging of production flows

Within the [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway] [Packages][] page, support for debugging of production flows has been introduced.

From the [Packages][] [Running Executions grid][Running Executions tab], users can:

* see who is attached to a running flow execution
* attach to running flow executions, which opens the flow in a [Flow Editor][User Guide - Flow Editor] in debug mode
* use the full set of debugging tools while attached
* detach from running flow executions
* show an error if attach or detach fails

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
Any changes made while debugging a production flow are transient and will not be saved to the underlying flow Package.

#### Performance

##### Optimised Execution Management Service event batching

The [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][] now batches execution start/end events, reducing inter‑service traffic.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]

##### Improved Execution Service concurrency and caching

The [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][] now uses semaphores to coordinate asynchronous cache access, ensuring that the same flow isn't translated multiple times when executed concurrently for the first time.
Additionally, various performance optimisations have been made within the service.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][]

#### Observability

##### Expanded block logging

The `Event` section of the block logging has been expanded to include additional details and tags:

* `Details`
  * `Exception`: the exception when a block errors
  * `GatewayUrl`: the path to append to the Gateway URL to take the user to the block the log is referring to
* `Tags`
  * `Cortex`
    * `Block.Result.Status`: the result status of the block execution (e.g., `Succeeded`, `Errored`)
    * `Exception.Type`: the name of the exception thrown, if `Errored`

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][]

#### Installation

##### Improved OpenSSL certificate generation

The OpenSSL certificate generation process has been modified.  
The certificate script now generates certificates locally and then securely copies them to target servers, removing reliance on PowerShell remoting.  
This approach reduces environmental prerequisites and works better in restricted remoting environments.

Affected Components:

* {{% ctx %}} App Server Install Scripts

#### Upgrade

##### Changed location of CertificateSettings for Service Fabric services

The `CertificateSettings` has been moved from the `Settings.xml` to the `appsettings.json` file for the following services:

* [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Listeners Service][]

This prevents the need to update the `version` number of the `ConfigPackage` when changing the certificate subject name within the `ServiceManifest`.

* {{% ctx %}} App Server Install Scripts
* {{% ctx %}} Upgrade Scripts
