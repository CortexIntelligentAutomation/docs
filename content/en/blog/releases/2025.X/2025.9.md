### Features

#### Capability

##### Added multi‑factor authentication (MFA) via OpenID Connect on {{% ctx %}} Gateway

Within [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway], administrators can now configure one or more `OpenID Connect` identity providers to enable MFA-backed sign‑in.  

A new `Authentication` admin page (replacing `LDAP Connection`) centralises authentication setup, allowing you to:

* edit an existing `LDAP` connection
* add, edit, and remove `OpenID Connect` providers

The existing `LDAP Authorisation` has been renamed to`Authorisation` to reflect that both `LDAP` and `OpenID Connect` providers can be configured.  

Once an `OpenID Connect` provider is configured, users may authenticate with either the new provider or continue using `LDAP`.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

##### Enabled debugging of production flows

Within the [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway] > [Packages][] page, support for debugging of production flows has been introduced.

From the [Packages][] > [Running Executions][Running Executions tab] grid, users can:

* see who is attached to a running flow execution
* attach to running flow executions, which opens the flow in a [Flow Editor][User Guide - Flow Editor] in debug mode
* use the full set of debugging tools while attached
* detach from running flow executions
* see an error if attach or detach fails

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
Any changes made while debugging production flows are transient and only apply to the flow executions that have been attached to; they will not apply to existing unattached or new executions, and will not be saved to the underlying flow Package.
{{% /alert %}}

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]

##### Added 'quick add' blocks to the Flow Editor

Within the [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway] > [Flow Editor][User Guide - Flow Editor], it is now possible to quickly add blocks without needing to drag from the [Palettes][].

When a block is selected, arrows are now shown on each port of the block.  
Clicking an arrow opens the [Palettes][] in a pop‑up filtered to only show blocks that can be connected.  
Selecting a block:

* adds the block to the flow
* connects it to the selected port and positions it correctly
* shifts already connected blocks where necessary, expanding the [workspace][] canvas when placement falls outside the current view

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

##### Extended Licence Fingerprint Generator

The `Licence Fingerprint Generator` now supports generating fingerprints based on a selected set of hardware components. This allows for more granular control when generating licence fingerprints to cater for hardware changes.
