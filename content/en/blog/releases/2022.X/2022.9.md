### Features

#### Improved Performance vs 7.X

The 2022.9 release has shown significant performance improvements compared to 7.X both in our own observations and customers installations. For example, one customer solution that has been migrated to 2022.9 has shown the time taken to run their tests reduce from 210 minutes to 10 minutes.

#### New HA architecture

Innovation can be installed on-premise across multiple servers with our new [high availability (HA) architecture][Innovation Only - Multiple Server - With HA] based on Microsoft's [Service Fabric][]. This provides:

- Elimination of single points of failure resulting in reduced downtime
- The ability to perform zero downtime upgrades
- Increased processing capacity resulting in increased throughput

It also lays the foundations for future releases to provide:

- Manual scaling and on demand automated scaling
- Single click deployments and upgrades
- Multi Tenancy, including the ability to choose the level of separation of tenants based on your compliance and hardware constraints

The use of Service Fabric currently permits deployment on VMs hosted with any [cloud service provider][], and in future deploying on Microsoft's [Azure Service Fabric][Service Fabric] and [Linux][] based operating systems.

Affected Components:

- [Cortex API Gateway Service][]
- [Cortex Flow Execution Service][]

#### New Innovation Engine

A new engine, which executes the automation solutions developed for the Innovation Platform, has been created. In early customer deployments this has shown a [dramatic improvement in performance vs the 7.X Engine][Improved Performance vs 7.X].

The new engine supports [expressions][] written in the [C# Programming Language][C# code].

It also lays the foundations for future releases to provide:

- [Autogeneration][] of new blocks from existing dotnet [dlls][] and [nuget packages][]
- An [SDK][] to develop your own blocks
- Execution of automation solutions on [Linux][] based operating systems
- Execution of automation solutions on serverless cloud services such as Microsoft's [Azure Functions][] and [AWS Lambda][]

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Flow Debugger Service][]
- [Cortex Flow Execution Service][]

#### Innovation Engine Requires New Cortex.lic Licence

A new Cortex.lic licence is required in order to [debug][] flows developed for the Innovation Engine and [execute][] them in Production.

For more information about licensing requirements, including how to obtain a licence, see:

Installing Innovation Only:

- [Multiple Server - With HA][Innovation Only - Multiple Server - With HA]
- [Single Server - Without HA][Innovation Only - Single Server - Without HA]

Adding Innovation to a 7.2 Installation:

- [Multiple Server - With HA][Adding Innovation to a 7.2 Installation - Multiple Server - With HA]
- [Single Server - Without HA][Adding Innovation to a 7.2 Installation - Single Server - Without HA]

Please note 7.2 installations still require a g2.ok licence for each Cortex Server component.

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Flow Debugger Service][]
- [Cortex Flow Execution Service][]

#### 180+ New Blocks

180+ new [Blocks][] have been added to the Innovation platform to work with:

- [Data][]
- [Date & Time][]
- [Decisions][]
- [Dictionaries][]
- [Email][]
- [Exceptions][]
- [Files & Folders][]
- [Flows][]
- [Google Workspace][]
- [Http][]
- [Lists][]
- [Logs][]
- [Microsoft365][]
- [Objects][]
- [PowerShell][]
- [Schedules][]
- [Ssh][]
- [Text][]
- [Variables][]
- [Workspaces][]
- [Xml][]

Many palettes include blocks for performing single and batch operations, such as [copying a single file][Copy File] or [copying multiple files][Copy Files].

In comparison to 7.X, improvements have been made to:

- The performance of blocks in the Innovation platform
- The consistency in naming of blocks and properties in relation to their functionality
- The consistency in functionality across similar palettes such as [Lists][] and [Dictionaries][]

Most blocks have a [Block Timeout][] property that can be used to cancel a block operation if it has run for longer than intended.

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Block Packages][Blocks]

#### New concept of Encryptable and Encrypted Text

The concept of Encryptable and Encrypted text has been added to the Innovation Engine, allowing for data to be encrypted and handled by the platform.

Two [data types][Concept: Data Types] have been added, [EncryptableText][] and [EncryptedText][]. Any block property using [EncryptableText][] allows for encrypted, partially encrypted or unencrypted values to be used. Any block property using [EncryptedText][] will only allow encrypted values to be used, throwing an error if partially encrypted or unencrypted values are used.

The same encryption mechanism is used in both the 2022.9 and the 7.X platforms.

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Flow Debugger Service][]
- [Cortex Flow Execution Service][]
- [Cortex Studio][]
- [Cortex Block Packages][Blocks]

#### New Property Editor

A new [Property Editor][] has been added to [Cortex Studio][] for configuring [blocks][block], allowing for quicker configuration and better ease of use compared to 7.X.

Each [Block Property][] can be configured using one of three new editors:

- [Variable Editor][New Property Editor: Variable Editor]
- [Literal Editor][New Property Editor: Literal Editor]
- [Expression Editor][New Property Editor: Expression Editor]

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Flow Debugger Service][]
- [Cortex Flow Execution Service][]
- [Cortex Studio][]
- [Cortex Block Packages][Blocks]

##### Variable Editor

The [Variable Editor][Guide: Variable Editor] is used to select, create and rename [variables][fundamentals: variables] that will be used by a [block][]. It has [typeahead][] selection of variables accessible by the block being configured, highlighting if the variable selected is missing and not available.

The Variable Editor allows for the creation of missing variables at the [scope][] of the block being configured.

The Variable Editor allows for a variable to be renamed from within the editor, also updating any references to this variable in the [flow][].

##### Literal Editor

The [Literal Editor][Guide: Literal Editor] is used to create [complex data types][] more easily, allowing you to switch between any available [Data Types][] for the [Block Property][] selected.

Please note that the Literal Editor does not currently support any [Collection][] data types, this may change in a future release.

##### Expression Editor

The [Expression Editor][Guide: Expression Editor] allows for use of [C# code][] for the [Block Property][] selected. It contains built in encryption to convert any text highlighted to an [EncryptedText][].

It also has:

- Built-in [snippets][] that are filtered based on the [Block Property][] selected to help configure the block
- Built-in [tools][], such as Full Screen, Find and Replace, Change all occurrences, etc

##### Other Features of the Property Editor

Other features of the [Property Editor][] include:

- Creating all missing [variables][fundamentals: variables] required by a [block][] using the [Add Variables button][]
- Every [block][] has a sensible editor selected for each [Block Property][], as well as a sensible default value to minimise the configuration required
- [Advanced Properties][] that do not normally need to be configured have preset default values and are hidden from view
- [Advanced Properties][] can be shown for more complex configuration of blocks using the [Show/Hide Advanced Properties button][]
- The Product Portal page for a block can be accessed from the [Property Editor][] by using the [Help button][]

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Flow Debugger Service][]
- [Cortex Studio][]

#### Messages

Validation is now performed before a [flow execution][] begins, the process will evaluate the [flow][] assessing for any issues that would cause the flow to fail and returns them as [validation errors][].

After [validating a flow][] in development, any [validation message][] in the [messages grid][] can be double clicked to navigate to the source of the issue.

This feature lays the foundations for future releases to provide configurable best practices, where a system can have:

- Control over whether a validation rule is classed as an error, warning, information, or shown at all
- Control over whether a flow can be run or debugged, committed, or published when specific validation rules are broken
- Suggested automatic fixes for specific error, warning, and information messages, including a single click application of the fix
- Suggested manual fixes for specific error, warning, and information messages, including a description of how to apply the fix
- Additional classification of rules such as performance, security, and development best practices

It also leads to the:

- Identification of fixes that need to be applied to flows in order to migrate them to a new version of the Innovation Platform
- Required automatic fixes, including a single click application of the fix
- Required manual fixes, including a description of how to apply the fix

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Flow Debugger Service][]
- [Cortex Flow Execution Service][]
- [Cortex Studio][]

#### Flow Contract

[Flows][flow] can now declare which [Input Variables][] are required to run the flow, and what [Output Variables][] will be returned by the flow. This is called the Flow Contract.

If a call to start a flow [execution][flow execution] does not meet the requirements of the Flow Contract, then the execution will not begin and [validation errors][] will be returned.

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Flow Debugger Service][]
- [Cortex Flow Execution Service][]
- [Cortex Studio][]

#### Calling other Flows

[Flows][flow] can be called from within another flow by using the [Run Flow][] block, passing in any [Input Variables][] required by the child flow, and returning any [Output Variables][] when the child flow's [execution][flow execution] has completed.

By default a new flow is set up to [handle any exceptions at the flow level][] and end the flow without error. However, when calling a child flow it may be useful to propagate any [exceptions][what is an exception] to the parent flow; this can be done by using the [Rethrow Exception][] block within the [Handle Flow Exception][] workspace, causing the flow to end with an error.

Please note:

- Flows can only be run synchronously and the parent flow will wait for any child flow execution to finish before continuing. This may change in a future release to support running flows asynchronously
- In 7.X, flows could also call subtasks. In 2022.9 and onwards, subtasks no longer exist

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Flow Debugger Service][]
- [Cortex Flow Execution Service][]
- [Cortex Studio][]

#### Debug with Input Variables

When [debugging][debug] a [flow][], any [Input Variables][] can be provided within the [Input Variables property][] in the flow's [Settings Editor][].

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Flow Debugger Service][]
- [Cortex Studio][]

#### Package Management

A new [Package Management][Guide: Package Management] system has been added to [Cortex Studio][] and allows a [flow developer][flow developers] to:

- Create a Package
- Add new versions of a Package
- Publish specific version(s) of a Package
- Unpublish specific version(s) of a Package
- Export a Package version out of [Cortex Studio][]
- Import a Package version into [Cortex Studio][]

Packages are intended to represent self contained automation solutions and are aimed at improving the speed and ease of deploying these solutions into production.

Packages introduce the ability to host and execute multiple automation solutions on the same platform/hardware (reducing costs), as well as being able to run multiple versions of the same solution (permitting [CI/CD][]).

The [Cortex API Gateway Service][] exposes a [versioned API][API: Gateway] for executing flows in specific packages and package versions. This allows for the integration with third party applications, websites or toolings such as [CI/CD][] Pipelines.

This feature lays the foundations for future releases to provide multi tenancy with environment variables.

Affected Components:

- [Cortex API Gateway Service][]
- [Cortex Flow Execution Service][]
- [Cortex Studio][]

#### Structured Logging

Structured logging provides a defined format for [logs][reference: logs] produced by the Innovation Platform, this helps with reporting and diagnostics and is used as the source of [dashboards][Grafana Dashboards]. The structured logs produced are in a [JSON][] format.

Structured logging has been added to the following components:

- [Cortex API Gateway][Logs: API Gateway]
- [Cortex Flow Debugger Service][Logs: Flow Debugger Service]

The ability to write structured logs has also been exposed to [flow developers][] so they can write logs in the same format as the platform; they can be created by using the [Log Event][] block.

Please note that structured logging may be added to more components in a future release.

This feature provides telemetry which can be used in future to offer request tracing and configurable alerting within the Innovation Platform.

Affected Components:

- [Cortex API Gateway Service][]
- [Cortex Flow Debugger Service][]

#### Grafana Dashboards

[Dashboards][] have been created to provide observability of the Innovation Platform in Production.

The new dashboards are:

- [Platform Health][]
- [Flow Execution Requests][]

In future additional dashboards may be added. Currently, these have been produced for [Grafana][] and in future releases other reporting and observability platforms such as [Splunk][] and [Elastic][] may be supported.

For more information about adding observability to Innovation see:

- [Installing Grafana On-Premise][]
- [Setup Grafana Cloud][]

Affected Components:

- None

#### Simplified Installation

The installation of 2022.9 has been improved in comparison to the 7.X Platform.

The installation is:

- Simpler and easier to perform
- Quicker with significantly fewer steps

Also, the installation documentation is clearer and more concise, whilst being more comprehensive.

This feature lays the foundations for future releases to provide single click installation of development and production environments from [Cortex Studio][].

Affected Components:

- None

#### Versioned APIs

The Innovation Platform has been developed with an API First approach, allowing the APIs used within the platform to be more robust and easier to use compared to the 7.X platform.

API Versioning has been applied to the [Cortex API Gateway Service][API: Gateway] and [Cortex Flow Debugger Service][API: Flow Debugger Service], this means that improvements can be made to the APIs without breaking automation solutions when new updates are rolled out.

Affected Components:

- [Cortex API Gateway Service][]
- [Cortex Flow Debugger Service][]

#### Product Portal

The Product Portal contains materials regarding the 2022.9 release and how to use the product; it is hosted online but can be hosted locally if required.

[Cortex Studio][] integrates with the portal, providing links to documentation for Blocks and Exceptions. In future this may extend to Validation Messages, Guides, Tutorials, etc.

[Cortex Studio][] can be configured to connect and integrate with a locally hosted version of the Product Portal; typically this would only be required for air gapped systems where connectivity to the internet is unavailable.

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Studio][]
