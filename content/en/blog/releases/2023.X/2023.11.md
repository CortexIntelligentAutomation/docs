### Features

#### Expansion of the HA Platform

##### Trigger Service Supports SNMPV3

The [Triggers][{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service] service has been expanded to allow triggering executions of flows within the {{% ctx %}} Innovation platform when specific SNMPV3 Traps are received.

SNMPV3 Triggers and Users can be added or deleted, when managing a version of a package within [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway].

Triggers can be configured to control when the execution occurs, and a trigger can be created with input variables that are passed to the execution. Triggers for SNMPV3 allow for the running of flows based on specific filters, including:

* Device Address
* Device Port
* Trap OID

Additional types of trigger (e.g. files created, emails received, Kafka topic notifications) may also be added in future releases.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service]
* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

##### Improved Logging within the HA Platform

A number of services have had improved logging introduced, initially this targets services that are used within the execution of automation solutions in order to provide insight and traceability when flows are executed within the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform.

The following components have had improved logging introduced:

* [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service]
  * Structured logging has been extended with tags when http requests are made to the service
* [{{% ctx %}} Scheduling Service][{{% ctx %}} Scheduling Service]
  * Structured logging has been added for when a scheduled job is triggered, containing the details of the job and whether the start execution request was made successfully
* [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service]
  * Structured logging has been added for when a trap is received by the service, containing the details of the trap
  * Structured logging has been added for when a trap meets the conditions of a trigger, containing the details of the trigger and whether the start execution request was made successfully
* [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][{{% ctx %}} Execution Service]
  * Structured logging has been added for when a message to start an execution is received by the service, containing the details of the message

All new structured logs contain the following shared details:

Improved Logging will continue to be expanded and introduced across the HA Platform in upcoming releases.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Scheduling Service][{{% ctx %}} Scheduling Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][{{% ctx %}} Execution Service]

#### Remove Dependency on SQL Server

With the deprecation of SQL Server within the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform, the following {{% ctx %}} Gateway views no longer have a dependency on SQL Server:

* Settings - LDAP Authorisation
* Settings - Studio Servers
* Settings - Studio Authorisation

Dependency on SQL Server will be removed from the remaining views in the next release in line with the [deprecation of SQL Server][].

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### New Blocks

Two new [Blocks][] have been added to the Innovation platform to work with:

* [Text][] - Allowing for searching for values within text, using a number of methods e.g. Contains Text, Pattern Matching, and Regex
  * [Find Text][]
  * [Find All Text][]

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### Oracle Support Added for the Execute Data Command Block

Support for Oracle Data Connections has been added for the [Execute Data Command][] block, this functionality has been added through the addition of the new [OracleConnectionDetails][] data type.

The new [OracleConnectionDetails][] supports a large range of connection strings used to connect to oracle data sources (e.g. TNS, Pooled Connections, etc)

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### Encrypted Headers are Supported in the Execute HTTP Request Block

Headers within the [Execute HTTP Request] block now allow for encrypted values to be passed through, the block will decrypt the headers when executing the HTTP request.

This allows for sensitive information to be used within the block whilst providing a layer of security for any sensitive data.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### Improved Installation

The installation process of the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform has been improved in the following ways:

* A new encryption key generator has been created which creates a new encryption key used by the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform, and publishes the encryption key to all specified machines
* The Cortex.Innovation.Test.PortUsage.ps1 script has been extended to test for the following ports, reporting if they are free:
  * LoadBalancer TCP Port test for 443 (Used for TLS)
  * LoadBalancer UDP Port test for 162 (Used for UDP)
  * Application Server UDP Port test for 10001 (Used for UDP)
* The HA Platform has been updated to use Service Fabric 10.0.1816.9590, this provides any associated improvements to security, memory utilisation and performance.

Affected Components:

* None

#### CORTEX Gateway Rebranding

The themes in {{% ctx %}} Gateway have had minor improvements applied based on user feedback.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### Product Portal

Reference documentation has been added for the [new blocks][New Blocks], [Oracle Data Connection support][Support for Oracle Data Connections], [Supporting encrypted headers in the Execute HTTP Request block][Encrypted Headers are Supported in the Execute HTTP Request Block], and the documentation has been updated to reflect the [improved installation][].

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed in the 2023.11 release of the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform:

#### Installation

##### Can't Add Windows Features during Gateway Install

Previously When installing {{% ctx %}} Gateway, the installation script could error with `"The request to add or remove features on the specified server failed"`. The {{% ctx %}} Gateway installation script now installs RSAT-AD-PowerShell in order to resolve this.

##### Server Certificate Password can't be Encrypted

Previously, the Cortex.Innovation.Install.ps1 script did not allow the ServerCertificatePassword to be encrypted otherwise it would error. The following passwords can now accept encrypted values:

* Cortex.Innovation.Install.ps1
  * ServerCertificatePassword
  * ClientCertificatePassword
* Cortex.Innovation.Update.Certificates.ps1
  * ServerCertificatePassword
  * ClientCertificatePassword

##### Service Fabric Install Script doesn't Handle Passwords with Special Characters

Previously, if passwords used in Cortex.Innovation.Install.ps1, Cortex.Innovation.Update.Certificates.ps1, and Cortex.Install.Gateway.ps1 contained special characters (e.g. *, ", <, >, etc) the installation would fail while installing the server and admin certificates for the platform. The following passwords can now accept any characters:

* Cortex.Innovation.Install.ps1
  * ServerCertificatePassword
  * ClientCertificatePassword
  * ApiGatewayBasicAuthPassword
  * LdapPassword
* Cortex.Innovation.Update.Certificates.ps1
  * ServerCertificatePassword
  * ClientCertificatePassword
* Cortex.Install.Gateway.ps1
  * ServiceFabricApiGatewayBasicAuthPassword
  * DotNetFlowDebuggerBasicAuthPassword

##### LoadBalancer Health Check could not be Excluded by Anti-Virus

Previously, the LoadBalancer Health Check scripts could not be excluded by Anti Virus Software due to being a PowerShell script. The LoadBalancer Health Check logic has been moved to an executable that can be excluded to improve the performance of the load balancer when it is checking the health of the connected nodes.

#### Data Storage

##### "Wait for Key in Collection to be Set" Triggered by Other Wait For Key Blocks

Previously, if a execution is running and waiting on a [Wait for Key in Collection to be Set][] block, the execution would continue when a [Wait for Key in Collection to Exist][] or [Wait for Key in Collection to Contain Value][] block was executed in another execution, the state of these blocks should have been independent.

#### Execution Service

##### Memory Usage Increases when Running Flows via the Scheduling and Triggers Service

Previously, memory usage would increase over time when the  [{{% ctx %}} Scheduling Service][] and [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][] executed flows with Input Variables, this has been fixed and a cache has been introduced to the [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][{{% ctx %}} Execution Service] to reduce the memory impact further.

#### Rebrand Gateway

##### "Unable to Load Flow" Body was Unreadable in Dark Mode

Previously, when navigating to a flow that was unavailable with Dark Mode enabled, the text displaying the reason was the same colour as the background making it unreadable.

##### Fullscreen Header for the Expression Editor does not have a Colour

Previously, no colour was present for the header of the Expression Editor whilst in fullscreen mode, this has been fixed to match the theme selected.

##### Notes Text Colour could not be Changed

Previously, notes within flows would not respect the font colour chosen.

##### Tick Boxes are not Visible in Light Mode

Previously, tick boxes used within a number of interfaces in {{% ctx %}} Gateway were not visible when using Light Mode.

##### Workspace Rename "OK" Button has no Styling

Previously, the "OK" button shown when renaming a workspace did not conform to the new themes.

#### Product Portal

##### Tutorial Videos Set to Private

Previously, the tutorial videos within the Product Portal were private and unavailable, these videos have now been set to public.

### Deprecated Features

There are no features deprecated as part of the 2023.11 release of the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform.

The following features were previously deprecated as part of the 2022.9 release of the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform:

#### SQL Server

* SQL Server will no longer be required by [Gateway][] in a future release; this was targeted for removal in 2023.3 or 2023.5, but has been pushed out, currently targeting the 2024.1 release

### Removed Features

There are no features removed as part of the 2023.11 release of the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform.
