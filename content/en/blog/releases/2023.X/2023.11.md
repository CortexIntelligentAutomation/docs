TODO:

* Capability
* Security
* Documentation

The [Triggers][Trigger Service SNMPV3] service has been has been expanded to allow the triggering executions of flows within the {{% ctx %}} Innovation platform when specific SNMPV3 Traps are received.

A number of services have had [improved logging introduced][], initially this targets services that are used within the execution of automation solutions in order to provide insight and traceability when flows are executed within the innovation platform

Dependency on SQL Server has been removed for a number of components within th {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform, this dependency will be removed from more components in subsequent releases in line with the [deprecation of SQL Server][] in the Innovation Plaform.

Two [new Blocks][New Blocks] have been added to the [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks], adding new functionality to work with:

* [Text][] - Allowing for searching for values within text, using a number of methods e.g. Contains, Pattern Matching, and Regex

[Support for Oracle Data Connections][] has been added for the [Execute Data Command][] block.

[Encrypted Headers are Supported in the Execute HTTP Request Block][], the block will decrypt the headers when executing the HTTP request.

The [installation process of the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform has been improved][improved installation] in a number of ways, such as improved generation of encryption keys and expanded port usage testing.

{{% ctx %}} Gateway [rebranding][CORTEX Gateway Rebranding] has continued to add further support for the light and dark themes introduced in the 2023.9 release.

The installation process of the [HA Platform][] has been improved. This includes:

* Improved validation when installing

### Features

#### Expansion of the HA Platform

##### Trigger Service Supports SNMPV3

The [Triggers][CORTEX Triggers Service] service has been has been expanded to allow the triggering executions of flows within the {{% ctx %}} Innovation platform when specific SNMPV3 Traps are received.

SNMPV3 Triggers can be added, or deleted, when managing a version of a package within [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway].

Triggers can be configured to control when the execution occurs, and a trigger can be created with input variables that are passed in to the execution. Triggers for SNMPV3 allow for the running of flows based on specific filters, including:

* Device Address
* Device Port
* Trap OID

Additional types of trigger (e.g. Files created, emails received, Kafka topic notifications) will also be added in future releases.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][CORTEX API Gateway Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][CORTEX Triggers Service]
* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

##### Improved Logging within the HA Platform

A number of services have had improved logging introduced, initially this targets services that are used within the execution of automation solutions in order to provide insight and traceability when flows are executed within the innovation platform

The following components have had improved logging introduced:

* [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][CORTEX API Gateway Service]
  * Structured logging has been extended when http requests are made to the service
* [{{% ctx %}} Scheduling Service][CORTEX Scheduling Service]
  * Structured logging has been added for when a scheduled job is triggered, containing the details of the job and whether the execution request was made successfully
* [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][CORTEX Triggers Service]
  * Structured logging has been added for when a trap is received by the service, containing the details of the trap
  * Structured logging has been added for when a trap meets the conditions of a trigger, containing the details of the trigger and whether the execution request was made successfully
* [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][CORTEX Execution Service]
  * Structured logging has been added for when a message to start an execution is received by the service, containing the details of the message

All new structured logs contain the following shared details:

* Type - Identifier for the type of logged event
* Duration - Information relating to when the logged event took place:
  * StartedAt - The DateTime representing when the log started
  * EndedAt - The DateTime representing when the log ended
  * InMs - The duration of the event in milliseconds
* Details - Details of the event, these are unique for each Type of event and contain more detailed information
* Tags - Common area for information related to the event that was logged, the Tags can be used to quickly search, group, or organise logs. The following are examples of tags:
  * `"Tenant.Name": "default"`
  * `"System.Name": "default"`
  * `"Package.Name": "package"`
  * `"Package.Version": "2023-11-30T13-27-06.User@gateway.b7a2eb1c-69ef-4623-bdf5-c3e5013935c3"`
  * `"Flow.Name": "flow"`
  * `"Trigger.Type": "Schedule.Cron"`
  * `"Http.Request.Method": "POST"`
  * `"Http.Response.StatusCode": "202"`
* Correlation - Contains information used to correlate and trace events through the system:
  * TraceId - Will be constant for all logged events that are related, allowing for the grouping of all logged events for a single interaction within the platform
  * SpanId - The unique identifier for the specific logged
  * ParentSpanId - The unique SpanId of the previous event that caused this log to be created, this allows for trace visualization using the logs
* Service - Information relating to where the logged event took place within the HA Platform
  * Name - The name of the service (e.g. `"fabric:/Core/Services/Scheduling"`)
  * NodeName - The name of the node hosting the specific instance of the service (e.g. `"Customer_Node_1"`)
  * PartitionId - The id of the partition of the service (e.g. `"cfa68727-c79e-45c1-b56d-2548b92b0dd2"`)
  * ReplicaOrInstanceId - The id of the replica or instance of the service (e.g. `"133458252865859302"`)
  * Type - The type name of the service (e.g. `"Scheduling"`)
  * IpAddressOrFqdn (e.g. `"customer.address.uk"`)

Improved Logging will continue to be expanded and introduced across the HA Platform in upcoming releases.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][CORTEX API Gateway Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Scheduling Service][CORTEX Scheduling Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][CORTEX Triggers Service]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][CORTEX Innovation Execution Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][CORTEX Execution Service]

#### Remove Dependency On SQL Server

With the deprecation of SQL Server within the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform, the following components no longer have a dependency on SQL Server:

* Remove StudioMappings from SQL Server Database
* Remove Studio Servers from database

Removal of SQL Server will continue across the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform in upcoming releases.

#### New Blocks

Two new [Blocks][] have been added to the Innovation platform to work with:

* [Text][] - Allowing for searching for values within text, using a number of methods e.g. Contains, Pattern Matching, and Regex
  * [Find Text][]
  * [Find All Text][]

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### Oracle Support Added for the Execute Data Command Block

Support for Oracle Data Connections has been added for the [Execute Data Command][] block, this functionality has been added through the addition of the new [OracleConnectionDetails][] data type.

The new [OracleConnectionDetails][] supports a large range of connection strings used to connect to oracle data sources (e.g. TNS, Pooled Connections, etc)

#### Encrypted Headers are Supported in the Execute HTTP Request Block

Headers within the [Execute HTTP Request] block now allow for encrypted values to be passed through, the block will decrypt the headers when executing the HTTP request.

This allows for sensitive information to be used within the block whilst providing a layer of security for any sensitive data.

#### Improved Installation

The installation process of the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform has been improved in the following ways:

* A new encryption key generator has been created which creates a new encryptin key used by the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform, and updates the encryption key on all specified machines
* The Cortex.Innovation.Test.PortUsage.ps1 script has been extended to test for the following ports, reporting if they are free:
  * LoadBalancer TCP Port test for 443 (Used for TLS)
  * LoadBalancer UDP Port test for 162 (Used for UDP)
  * Application Server UDP Port test for 10001 (Used for UDP)
* The HA Platform has been updated to use Service Fabric 10.0.1816.9590, this provides any associated improvements to security, memory utilisation and performance.

#### CORTEX Gateway Rebranding

{{% ctx %}} Gateway has been rebranded, this includes:

* Updating the fonts and colours
* Refreshing the icons
* Updating the debug token shown when debugging flows

Also, theme support has been added, and both light and dark themes have been included. It is possible to switch themes by clicking the user icon on the top right hand corner of the home page, selecting settings, and choosing light or dark theme. The choice of selected theme is persisted within your browser's local storage.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### Product Portal

The documentation has been updated to reflect the [new services][HA Platform], and reference documentation has been added for the [new blocks][New Blocks].

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed in the 2023.11 release:

#### Data Storage

##### Wait for Key in Collection to be Set triggered by other wait for key blocks

Previously, if a execution is running and waiting on a [Wait for Key in Collection to be Set][] block, the execution would continue when a [Wait for Key in Collection to Exist][] or [Wait for Key in Collection to Contain Value][] block was executed in another execution, the state of these blocks should have been independent.

#### Installation

##### Can't add Windows Features during Gateway Install

Previously When installing {{% ctx %}} Gateway, the installation script could error with `"The request to add or remove features on the specified server failed"`. The {{% ctx %}} Gateway installation script now installs RSAT-AD-PowerShell in order to resolve this.

##### Server Certificate Password Cant Be Encrypted

Previously, the Cortex.Innovation.Install.ps1 script did not allow the ServerCertificatePassword to be encrypted otherwise it would error. The following passwords can now accept encrypted values:

* Cortex.Innovation.Install.ps1
  * ServerCertificatePassword
  * ClientCertificatePassword
* Cortex.Innovation.Update.Certificates.ps1
  * ServerCertificatePassword
  * ClientCertificatePassword

##### Service Fabric Install script doesn't handle passwords with special characters

Previously, if passwords used in Cortex.Innovation.Instal.ps1, Cortex.Innovation.Update.Certificates.ps1, and Cortex.Install.Gateway.ps1 contained special characters the installation would fail while installing the server and admin certificates for the platform. The following passwords can now accept special characters:

* Cortex.Innovation.Install.ps1
  * ServerCertificatePassword
  * ClientCertificatePassword
  * ApiGatewayBasicAuthPassword
  * LdapPassword
* Cortex.Innovation.Update.Certificates.ps1
  * ServerCertificatePassword
  * ClientCertificatePassword
* Cortex.Install.Gateway.ps1
  * ServiceFabricApiGatewayBasicAuthPassword
  * DotNetFlowDebuggerBasicAuthPassword

##### LoadBalancer Health Check could not be Excluded by Anti-Virus

Previously, the LoadBalancer Health Check scripts could not be excluded by Anti Virus Software due to being a PowerShell script. The LoadBalancer Health Check logic has been moved to an executable that can be excluded to improve the performance of the load balancer when it is checking the health of the connected nodes.

#### Rebrand Gateway

##### "Unable to Load Flow" body was unreadable in Dark Mode

Previously, when navigating to a flow that was unavailable with Dark Mode enabled the text displaying the reason was the same colour as the background making it unreadable.

##### Fullscreen header for the Expression Editor does not have a colour

Previously, no colour was present for the header of the Expression Editor whilst in fullscreen mode, this has been fixed to match the theme selected.

##### Notes text colour did not change colour

Previously, notes within flows could not have their font colour updated.

##### Tick Boxes are not visible in Light Mode

Previously, tick boxes used within a number of interfaces in {{% ctx %}} Gateway were not visable when using Light Mode.

##### Workspace rename "OK" button has no proper styling

Previously, the "OK" button shown when renaming a workspace did not conform to the new rebrand guidelines.

##### Error Details are not Readable

TODO: This looks like it affects G2 flows

#### Execution Service

##### Memory usage increases when running flows using the editor syntax

Previously, memory usage would increase over time while running flows that used the editor syntax for Input Variables, this has been fixed and a cache has been introduced to the [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][CORTEX Execution Service] to reduce the memory impact of Input Variables whilst using the editor syntax.

#### Product Portal

##### Tutorial Videos Set to Private

Previously, the tutorial videos within the Product Portal were private and unavailable, these videos have now been set to public.
