## Release Notes

### Overview

2023.3 is the second release of the next generation of Cortex and continues our journey to improve on the previous 7.X generation in the following areas:

- Performance
- Availability
- Scalability
- Usability
- Capability
- Documentation
- Third Party Support

This release shows performance improvements in a number of areas:

- Overall platform performance improvements due to upgrading to .Net6
- Reduced memory footprint due to the HA Platform being re-architected
- Reduced memory usage within the Innovation Engine
- General performance improvements when debugging automation solutions

The [HA Platform has been re-architected][Re-architected the HA Platform] to improve performance, reduce memory footprint, and support improved availability and scalability moving forwards, including, zero downtime upgrades of the platform, control of upgrading solutions running on the platform, and support for multi-tenancy.

A [new Welcome Page][New Welcome Page] has been added to Cortex Gateway, alongside the following usability improvements:

- [Automatic dependency selection in Package Management][Added Automatic Dependency Selection in Package Management]
- [Renaming of variables from the Variables Grid][Added Renaming of Variables to the Variables Grid]

Nine [new Blocks][New Blocks] have been added to the [Cortex Block Packages][Blocks], adding new functionality to work with [Queues][], and [encode][Encode Text] and [decode][Decode Text] text to various formats. Also, an [improvement][Improvements to Existing Blocks] has been made to the [Execute Ssh Command][Execute Ssh Command Remark] block to support paged responses.

Finally, this [Product Portal][] has been updated to reflect the [re-architected HA Platform][Re-architected the HA Platform], [Tutorials][] have been added, and multi-version support has been introduced to allow for easy switching between documentation for different versions of Cortex.

### Features

#### Re-architected the HA Platform

The [HA Platform][Innovation Only - Multiple Server - With HA] has been re-architected to improve performance, reduce memory footprint, and support improved availability and scalability moving forwards, the re-architecture includes:

- Adding a new [Provisioning Service][Cortex Provisioning Service], to provision and manage [Execution Services][Cortex Execution Service], this lays the foundations for side-by-side execution of automation solutions that are require different versions of the Innovation Engine and [Block Packages][Blocks] to run
- Replacing the functionality provided by the [removed][Removed Features] Flow Execution Service with three new services:
  - The [Package Management Service][Cortex Package Management Service], which stores information regarding packages, default packages and default package versions;
  - The [Licence Management Service][Cortex Licence Management Service], which validates and distributes licences to services within the [HA Platform][Innovation Only - Multiple Server - With HA]
  - [Execution Services][Cortex Execution Service], which execute automation solutions, caching them while they are in use to reduce execution time;
  - As a result of this, we have reduced the total memory footprint of the [HA Platform][Innovation Only - Multiple Server - With HA] and have allowed for more granular control over scaling specific services and resources within the platform
- [Updated Third Party Components][] within the HA Platform, gaining any associated performance and memory improvements they provide

It also lays the foundations for future releases to provide:

- Manual and on-demand automated scaling
- Single click deployments and zero downtime upgrades
- Control of what deployed automation solutions are upgraded and when
- Multi-tenancy, including the ability to choose the level of separation of tenants based on your compliance and hardware constraints

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Innovation Core Application][]
  - [Cortex API Gateway Service][]
  - [Cortex Licence Management Service][]
  - [Cortex Package Management Service][]
  - [Cortex Provisioning Service][]
- [Cortex Innovation Execution Application][]
  - [Cortex Execution Service][]
- [Cortex Studio][]

#### New Interaction Portal

A new web application called [Interaction Portal][] has been developed to support [Human-in-the-Loop][] automation in Cortex Innovation deployments, that was previously provided by Live Portal in the 7.X generation of the platform.

[CORS][] support has been added to the [API Gateway Service][Cortex API Gateway Service] as it is required by single server deployments that use the new [Interaction Portal][].

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Innovation Core Application][]
  - [Cortex API Gateway Service][]

#### New Blocks

Nine new [Blocks][] have been added to the Innovation platform to work with:

- [Queues][]
  - [Enqueue Item][]
  - [Enqueue Items][]
  - [Dequeue Item][]
  - [Dequeue Items][]

#### New Welcome Page

A new [Welcome Page][] has added to [Cortex Gateway][Gateway]. It acts as a landing page when signing in and provides the ability to quickly navigate to the last 20 recently edited flows for the signed-in user.

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Gateway][Gateway]

#### Added Automatic Dependency Selection in Package Management

To ensure incomplete packages cannot be published, [automatic selection of dependent flows][] has been added to the [Package Management][] system when creating new versions of a package.

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Studio][]

#### Added Renaming of Variables to the Variables Grid

To make developing automation solutions easier and quicker, variables can be [renamed][TODO: Variables Grid] from the [Variables Grid][]; renaming a variable will update any references to the variable in the flow.

[Validation of variable names][TODO: Variables Grid] has also been included to detect duplicate or invalid names; any duplicate or invalid names will be highlighted within the [Variables Grid][].

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Studio][]

#### Simplified Installation of the Web Application Server

The installation of 2023.3 has been improved in comparison to the previous 2022.9 release.

The manual steps required to install [Cortex Gateway][Gateway] have been automated, this means that the installation is:

- Simpler and easier to perform
- Quicker with significantly fewer steps

Also, the installation documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.

This feature lays the foundations for future releases to provide single click installation of development and production environments from [Cortex Studio][].

Affected Components:

- None

#### Improvements to Performance

The performance of [debugging automation solutions][] has been improved due to the time taken to perform dependency and git status checks being reduced.  

The memory usage of debugging automation solutions that require input variables has also been reduced, and garbage collection of memory that is no longer required has been improved.

Affected Components:

- [Cortex Flow Debugger Service][]
- [Cortex Gateway][Gateway]

#### Updated Third Party Components

The following third party components have been upgraded:
