## Release Notes

### Overview

TODO: links

2023.3 is the second release of the next generation of Cortex and continues our journey to improve on the previous 7.X generation in the following areas:

- Performance
- Availability
- Scalability
- Usability
- Capability
- Documentation
- Third Party Support

This release shows performance improvements in a number of areas:

- Overall platform performance improvements due to upgrading to .Net6
- Reduced memory footprint due to the re-architecture of the HA Platform
- Reduced memory usage within the Innovation Engine
- General performance improvements when debugging automation solutions

The [HA Platform has been re-architected][] to [improve performance][], [reduce memory footprint][], and support improved Availability and Scalability moving forwards, including, zero downtime upgrades of the platform, control of upgrading solutions running on the platform, and support for multi-tenancy.

A [New Welcome Page][] has been added to Cortex Gateway, alongside the following usability improvements:

- [Automatic Dependency Selection in Package Management][Added Automatic Dependency Selection in Package Management]
- [Renaming of Variables from the Variables Grid][Added Renaming of Variables to the Variables Grid]

Nine [New Blocks][] have been added to [Cortex Block Packages][Blocks], adding new functionality to work with [Queues][], and [encode][] and [decode][] text to various formats. Also, improvements have been made to the [Execute Ssh Command][] block to improve its usability within flows.

Finally, this [Product Portal][] has been updated to reflect the [re-architected HA Platform][], [Tutorials][] have been added, and multi-version support has been added to allow for easy navigation between different versions of Cortex.

### Features

#### Re-architected the HA Platform

TODO: Change "re-architecture" to "re-architected" phrasing
TODO: Look at linking the future sections to the road map
TODO: Links

The [HA Platform][Innovation Only - Multiple Server - With HA] has been re-architected to [improve performance][], [reduce memory footprint][], and support improved Availability and Scalability moving forwards, the re-architecture includes:

- A new [Provisioning Service][] has been added, to provision and manage [Execution Services][], it lays the foundations for side by side execution of automation solutions that are require different versions of the Innovation Engine and [Block Packages][Blocks] to run
- The Flow Execution Service has been replaced by three new services:
  - The [Package Management Service][], which stores information regarding packages, default packages and default package versions, to reduce the memory footprint
  - The [Licence Management Service][], which validates and distributes licences to services within the HA Platform
  - [Execution Services][], which execute automation solutions, caching them while they are in use to reduce execution time and memory footprint
- TODO: Include third party as the SF has been upgraded

It also lays the foundations for future releases to provide:

- Manual scaling and on demand automated scaling
- Single click deployments and zero downtime upgrades
- Control of upgrading deployed automation solutions
- Multi-tenancy, including the ability to choose the level of separation of tenants based on your compliance and hardware constraints
