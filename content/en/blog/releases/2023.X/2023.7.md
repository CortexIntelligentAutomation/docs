## Release Notes

### Overview

2023.7 is the fourth [Fast Track][] release of the next generation of {{% ctx %}} and continues our journey to improve on the previous 7.X generation in the following areas:

* Usability
* Capability
* Documentation

The following new services have been added to the [HA Platform][]:

* [Concurrency Management Service][] - Allows for the execution of blocks to be limited and controlled by access to a specific semaphore
* [Scheduling Service][] - Allows for scheduled execution of flows within the {{% ctx %}} Innovation platform

The [Flow Debugger service has been removed][], with the debugging capability moved in to the [Execution Service][CORTEX Execution Service]. This means that the debugging of flows can now be highly available if needed, and opens up the possibility of debugging executions in production in the future.

Five [new Blocks][New Blocks] have been added to the [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks], adding new functionality to work with:

* [Data Storage][] - Allowing for the creation and deletion of collections within the [Data Storage Service][CORTEX Data Storage Service], and the capability to read, write and delete data from collections

Two [new Common Properties][New Common Properties] have been added to most blocks within the [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks], adding new functionality to work with:

* [Semaphore][Semaphore Property] - Allowing for the execution of the block to be limited and controlled by accessing a specific semaphore
* [Run As][Run As Property] - Allowing for the execution of the block to run as an impersonated user

The [API Gateway][CORTEX API Gateway Service] has been consolidated and improved to return more consistent status codes, problem details, and data.

The [Interaction Portal][] has been worked on to improve the general experience in a number of areas.

The installation process of the [HA Platform][] has been improved. This includes:

* Improved validation when installing
* More descriptive errors

Finally, this [Product Portal][] has been updated to reflect the [new and upcoming services][HA Platform], and reference documentation has been added for the [new blocks][New Blocks] and [common properties][New Common Properties].

### Features

#### Expansion of the HA Platform

##### New Concurrency Management Service

The [Concurrency Management][CORTEX Concurrency Management Service] service has been added to the HA Platform, which allows for for the execution of blocks to be limited and controlled by access to a specific semaphore.

This can be configured individually for each block, by using the [new common block property][New Common Properties] for [semaphores][Semaphore Property] available on most blocks.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][CORTEX API Gateway Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Concurrency Management Service][CORTEX Concurrency Management Service]
* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

##### New Scheduling Service

The [Scheduling][CORTEX Scheduling Service] service has been added to the HA Platform, which allows for scheduled executions of flows within the {{% ctx %}} Innovation platform.

Schedules can be added, or deleted, when managing a version of a package within [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway].

This is [potentially breaking][API Gateway Consolidation] if you were interacting with responses returned by any API call to [API Gateway][CORTEX API Gateway Service].

#### New Blocks

Five new [Blocks][] have been added to the Innovation platform to work with:

* [Data Storage][] - Allowing for the creation and deletion of collections within the [Data Storage Service][CORTEX Data Storage Service], and the capability to read, write and delete data from collections
  * [Create Collection][]
  * [Delete Collection][]
  * [Read Data with Key][]
  * [Write Data with Key][]

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][CORTEX Innovation Execution Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][CORTEX Execution Service]
* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### New Common Block Properties

Two new [Common Properties][] have been added to most blocks:

* [Semaphore][Semaphore Property] - Allowing for the execution of the block to be limited and controlled by accessing a specific semaphore
* [Run As][Run As Property] - Allowing for the execution of the block to run as an impersonated user

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Concurrency Management Service][CORTEX Concurrency Management Service]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][CORTEX Innovation Execution Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][CORTEX Execution Service]
* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### Improved Interaction Portal

The [Interaction Portal][] has been worked on to improve the general experience.
The areas that have been worked on are:

* High Availability Nodes
* HA Shared Data Integration
  * Shared Data Migration: Export and Import
* OAuth integration
* Security Enhancements
* Other general improvements

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Interaction Portal][Interaction Portal]

#### Improved Installation Process

Customer feedback has been addressed to improve the installation process of {{% ctx %}} Innovation, this includes improved validation when installing and more descriptive errors.

#### Product Portal

The documentation has been updated to reflect the [new and upcoming services][HA Platform], and reference documentation has been added for the [new blocks][New Blocks] and [Common Properties][New Common Properties].

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed in the 2023.7 release:

#### Execute Http Request block returns Unauthorised when using Basic Auth

When trying to call an endpoint with the [Execute Http Request][] block in the 2023.5 platform, using Basic Auth, the call responds with 401 unauthorised response despite using the correct credentials.

This issue has been resolved as part of the 2023.7 platform.

#### DuplicatedBlockIdException Thrown when Two Third Parties Make a Call to Start an Execution at the Same Time

When two third parties make a call to start an execution of the same flow at the same time, one would return a DuplicatedBlockIdException and fail to run the flow. This would only happen once, then the issue would be resolved for that version of a package.

This issue has been resolved as part of the 2023.7 platform.

#### EncryptedText Parameters in the Execute PowerShell Script Block Passed the Redacted Value to the Script

When an [EncryptedText][] variable is passed through the parameters in the [Execute PowerShell Script][] block, the redacted text would be used instead of the decrypted value of the EncryptedText Variable.

This issue has been resolved as part of the 2023.7 platform.

#### Input Variables with an EncryptedText Default Value Appends Quotes to Beginning and End of Input

Any input variable with a default value of `new EncryptedText(<Any Text Value>)`, would cause any value passed into the input variable when starting a flow to be wrapped in quotes (e.g. `new List<int>()` would be wrapped and become `"new List<int>()"`).

This issue has been resolved as part of the 2023.7 platform.

#### Cortex Data Types could not be Serialised with TypeNameHandling set to All

When trying to serialise any Cortex [Data Type][] using the [Convert Object To Json][] block, when TypeNameHandling was set to `TypeNameHandling.All`, subsequent use of any Cortex Data Type would cause any block to throw a JsonSerialisationException.

This issue has been resolved as part of the 2023.7 platform.

#### StackOverflowException Thrown when Deserialising Structures with TypeNameHandling set to All

When trying to deserialise any Cortex [Data Type][] using the [Convert Json To Object][] block, when TypeNameHandling was set to `TypeNameHandling.All`, a StackOverflowException would be thrown by the block.

This issue has been resolved as part of the 2023.7 platform.

### Deprecated Features

The following features have been deprecated in the 2023.7 release:

* Support for Windows Server 2016 will be removed in a future release, this is targeted for 2023.9 or 2023.11, and support for Windows Server 2022 will be added.

The following features were previously deprecated in the 2022.9 release:

* SQL Server will no longer be required by [Gateway][] in a future release; this was targeted for removal in 2023.3 or 2023.5, but has been pushed out, currently targeting the 2024.1 release

### Removed Features

#### Removed Flow Debugger Service

The Flow Debugger Service has been removed, with the debugging capability moved in to the [Execution Service][CORTEX Execution Service].

This means that the debugging of flows can now be highly available if needed, and opens up the possibility of debugging executions in production in the future.

### Potential Breaking Changes

The following may potentially break interactions with the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform.

#### Improved Consistency of API Gateway

Responses from [API Gateway][CORTEX API Gateway Service] have been consolidated and improved, they now return more consistent status codes, messages and data.

This is potentially breaking if you were interacting with responses returned by any API call to [API Gateway][CORTEX API Gateway Service] (i.e. a 3rd party system, or a flow using the [Execute Http Request][] block to call API Gateway endpoints). Any occurrence of this will need to be updated to use the new response.

### Breaking Changes

There are no known breaking changes as part of this release of the platform.

### Known Limitations

There are no known limitations added as part of this release of the platform.
