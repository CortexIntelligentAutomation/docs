* Capability
* Documentation

The following new services have been added to the [HA Platform][]:

* [Triggers Service][] - Allows for the execution of flows based on specific triggers. Currently, the Triggers Service  allows for triggering executions of flows within the {{% ctx %}} Innovation platform when specific SNMP Traps are received.

Six [new Blocks][New Blocks] have been added to the [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks], adding new functionality to work with:

* [Data Storage][] - Allowing for communication between flows by using the shared Data Storage within the HA Platform

{{% ctx %}} Gateway has been [rebranded][CORTEX Gateway Rebranding] and theme support for light and dark mode has been added.

Support for [Windows Server 2022][Windows Server 2022 Support] has been added to the Innovation Platform as part of the 2023.9 release, and support for [Windows Server 2016][Windows Server 2016 Support] has been removed.

### Features

#### Expansion of the HA Platform

##### New Triggers Service

The [Triggers][CORTEX Triggers Service] service has been added to the HA Platform, which allows for triggering executions of flows within the {{% ctx %}} Innovation platform when specific SNMP Traps are received.

SNMP Triggers can be added, or deleted, when managing a version of a package within [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway].

Triggers can be configured to control when the execution occurs, and a trigger can be created with input variables that are passed in to the execution. Currently, triggers for both SNMPV1 and SNMPV2 traps have been added, allowing for the running of flows based on specific filters related to these SNMP Versions, including:

* Device Address
* Device Port
* Trap OID
* Community (Available for SNMPV1 and SNMPV2)
* Agent Address (Available for SNMPV1)

Support for SNMPV3 will be added in a future release, this is targeted for 2023.11 or 2024.1.

Additional types of trigger (e.g. Files created, emails received, Kafka topic notifications) will also be added in future releases.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][CORTEX API Gateway Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][CORTEX Triggers Service]
* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### New Blocks

Six new [Blocks][] have been added to the Innovation platform to work with:

* [Data Storage][] - Allowing for communication using the shared Data Storage within the HA Platform
  * [Wait For Collection To Exist][]
  * [Wait For Collection To Not Exist][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Exist][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Not Exist][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Contain Value][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Be Set][]

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Data Storage Service][CORTEX Data Storage Service]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][CORTEX Innovation Execution Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][CORTEX Execution Service]
* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### CORTEX Gateway Rebranding

{{% ctx %}} Gateway has been rebranded, this includes:

* Updating the fonts and colours
* Refreshing the icons
* Updating the debug token shown when debugging flows

Also, theme support has been added, and both light and dark themes have been included. It is possible to switch themes by clicking the user icon on the top right hand corner of the home page, selecting settings, and choosing light or dark theme. The choice of selected theme is persisted within your browser's local storage.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### Windows Server 2022 Support

Support for Windows Server 2022 has been added to the Innovation Platform as part of the 2023.9 release, and support for [Windows Server 2016][Windows Server 2016 Support] has been removed.

Affected Components:

* None

#### Product Portal

The documentation has been updated to reflect the [new services][HA Platform], and reference documentation has been added for the [new blocks][New Blocks].

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed in the 2023.9 release:

#### Some Cortex DataTypes could not be Serialised

Some {{% ctx %}} [Data Types][] were not serialisable within the Innovation platform, all [Data Types][] have been verified and updated to be serialisable.

#### Updating Certificates with Different Casing for Node Names Caused the Certificates to be Invalid

When updating certificates within the Innovation platform, any nodes with different casing from the previous certificate would not be valid. This has been fixed, and certificates with different casing will now match the nodes correctly.

#### TLS Bug with CortexSSLBestPractices Script

The CortexSSLBestPractices script previously did not correctly disable TLS1.1.

#### Write Data with Key Block does not Accept Null Values

The [Write Data with Key] block previously threw an exception when `null` was passed into the `Data` property, this has now been fixed and `null` can be saved to the [Data Storage Service][CORTEX Data Storage Service].

#### Grafana Promtail Incorrectly Reporting of 4XX and 5XX Error Codes as Successful

Grafana Promtail was previously reporting 4XX and 5XX error codes within problem details as successful requests but now report correctly.

#### Running Parallel Flows can Cause an Exception to Occur

The same flow being called asynchronously and running in parallel could cause an exception to be thrown when two flows were executing the same block. This issue has been fixed, and concurrent execution of the same flows no longer throw exceptions in this case.

#### Scope Default Value is not set until the Block was Updated

Previously, any block that used [Scope][] would not have a default value set when placing the block on a flow for the first time, until the block had been updated.

#### Incorrect Help Links for Data Storage Blocks

The following [Data Storage][] blocks had incorrect links to their documentation pages:

* [Read Data with Key][]
* [Write Data with Key][]
* [Delete Data with Key][]

This was due to their namespaces being incorrect, this is a [potentially breaking change][Data Storage Block Namespace Change] if you were using these blocks within a flow.

### Deprecated Features

The following features were previously deprecated in the 2022.9 release:

* SQL Server will no longer be required by [Gateway][] in a future release; this was targeted for removal in 2023.3 or 2023.5, but has been pushed out, currently targeting the 2024.1 release

### Removed Features

The following features have been removed in the 2023.9 release:

#### Windows Server 2016 Support

Support for Windows Server 2016 has been removed as part of the 2023.9 release, and [support for Windows Server 2022][Windows Server 2022 Support] has been added.

### Potential Breaking Changes

The following may potentially break interactions with the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform.

#### FlowExecutionStoppedException renamed to FlowExecutionCancelledException

The FlowExecutionStoppedException has been renamed to FlowExecutionCancelledException.

This is potentially breaking if you were interacting with the exception and using its name to make decisions within a flow. Any occurrence of this will need to be updated to use the new name.

#### Data Storage Block Namespace Change

The following [Data Storage][] blocks, have had their namespaces changed to be:

* [Read Data with Key][] - Cortex.Blocks.DataStorage.ReadData.ReadDataWithKeyBlock
* [Write Data with Key][] - Cortex.Blocks.DataStorage.WriteData.WriteDataWithKeyBlock
* [Delete Data with Key][] - Cortex.Blocks.DataStorage.DeleteData.DeleteDataWithKeyBlock

This is potentially breaking if you were using these blocks within a flow. Any flow using these blocks will need to be upgraded in order to continue working; please request assistance with upgrading flows by raising a case in the [{{% ctx %}} Service Portal][CORTEX Service Portal].

### Breaking Changes

There are no known breaking changes as part of this release of the platform.
