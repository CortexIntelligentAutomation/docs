### Features

#### Expansion of the HA Platform

##### New Triggers Service

TODO: Expand

The [Triggers][CORTEX Triggers Service] service has been added to the HA Platform, which allows for triggering executions of flows within the {{% ctx %}} Innovation platform when specific SNMP Traps are received.

SNMP Triggers can be added, or deleted, when managing a version of a package within [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway].

Triggers can be configured to control when the execution occurs, and a trigger can be created with input variables that are passed in to the execution. Currently, triggers for both SNMPV1 and SNMPV2 traps have been added, allowing for the running of flows based on specific filters

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][CORTEX API Gateway Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][CORTEX Triggers Service]
* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### New Blocks

Six new [Blocks][] have been added to the Innovation platform to work with:

* [Data Storage][] - Allowing for communication using the shared Data Storage within the HA Platform
  * [Wait For Collection To Exist][]
  * [Wait For Collection To Not Exist][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Exist][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Not Exist][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Contain Value][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Be Set][]

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Data Storage Service][CORTEX Data Storage Service]
