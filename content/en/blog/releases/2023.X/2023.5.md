### Features

#### New Blocks

Six new [Blocks][] have been added to the Innovation platform to work with:

* [Flows][]
  * [Run Flow Async][]
* [Tasks][]
  * [Wait For Task Block][]
  * [Wait For All Tasks Block][]
  * [Cancel Task Block][]
  * [Cancel All Tasks Block][]
* [Telnet][]
  * [Execute Telnet Command][]

#### Expansion of the HA Platform

##### New Configuration Management Service

An API is now available to manage tenants/systems, and allows:

* Creating a new tenant/system
* Deleting tenants and systems
* Getting existing tenants and systems

The API currently only supports Basic Authorisation.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][CORTEX API Gateway Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Configuration Management Service][CORTEX Configuration Management Service]

##### New Data Storage Service

The [Data Storage Service][] has been added to the HA Platform architecture, which currently allows sharing of data between executions. The data will be segregated by tenant/system.

An API has been added to read and write data. The API currently only support Basic Authorisation.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][CORTEX API Gateway Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Data Storage Service][CORTEX Data Storage Service]

##### New Authorisation Service

The [Authorisation Service][] has been introduced to the HA Platform, the new service is responsible for Basic Authorisation and introduces OAuth2 authentication for the API Gateway Service.

The following features of OAuth are currently implemented:

* Password/Grant type
* Authentication against a single AD server
* Token and refresh token

Note: OAuth2 support is currently only available for the execution of flows in published packages, but will be expanded in future releases.

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][CORTEX API Gateway Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Authorisation Service][CORTEX Authorisation Service]

#### Introduced OAuth2 for Published Packages

With the introduction of the [Authorisation Service][], OAuth 2 is now supported. Currently, OAuth2 is only available for the execution of flows in published packages, but will be expanded in future releases.

The {{% ctx %}} Gateway [Packages][] settings page now allows for setting package authorisation, controlling who has access to run flows for that package using OAuth2.
Authorisation settings can be managed through the new `Authorisation` tab added to the package definition view, which is visible when clicking on a specific package version.

`Authorisation` settings are persisted when creating a new version and can be modified for each version independently.

An API is now available to authorise by creating a new OAuth token, or refreshing expired OAuth tokens.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
