## Release Notes

### Overview

2023.5 is the third [Fast Track][] release of the next generation of {{% ctx %}} and continues our journey to improve on the previous 7.X generation in the following areas:

* Usability
* Capability
* Security
* Documentation

The following new services have been added to the [HA Platform][]:

* [Configuration Management Service][] - Allows for future management of tenants/systems and platform configuration of a deployed {{% ctx %}} Innovation platform
* [Data Storage Service][] - Allows for sharing of data between flow executions
* [Authorisation Service][] - Allows for OAuth2 authentication within the API Gateway Service (currently only available for the execution of flows in published packages, but will be expanded in future releases)

[OAuth2 authorisation has been introduced for running flows in published packages][]. The [HA Platform][] can be configured to authenticate against a single Active Directory server, allowing authorised users to start a flow execution. Package Management within Gateway can be used to modify access control to any version of a package.

Six [new Blocks][New Blocks] have been added to the [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks], adding new functionality to work with:

* [Flows][] - Allowing for the execution of asynchronous flows, returning a task that can be waited for or cancelled at a later point in a flow
* [Tasks][] - Allowing waiting for a task to complete and then returning the output of the task, or cancelling a task that is currently running ending the execution of the task
* [Telnet][] - Allowing for connection to Telnet hosts, executing commands against them and returning their responses

The [Interaction Portal][] has been worked on to improve the general experience in a number of areas.

The installation process of the [HA Platform][] has been improved. This includes:

* Improved validation when installing
* More descriptive errors
* New parameters to configure the OAuth2 authorisation provider that is used by the new [Authorisation Service][]

Finally, this [Product Portal][] has been rebranded to follow We Are {{% ctx %}} branding guidelines, the documentation has also been updated to reflect the [new and upcoming services][HA Platform], and reference documentation has also been added for the [new blocks][New Blocks], as well as improvements to the existing [SSH data types][].

### Features

#### Expansion of the HA Platform

##### New Configuration Management Service

The [Configuration Management][CORTEX Configuration Management Service] service has been added to the HA Platform, which allows for future management of tenants/systems and platform configuration of a deployed {{% ctx %}} Innovation platform.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][CORTEX API Gateway Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Configuration Management Service][CORTEX Configuration Management Service]

##### New Data Storage Service

The [Data Storage Service][CORTEX Data Storage Service] has been added to the HA Platform, which allows for sharing of data between flow executions.

An API has been added to read and write shared data to and from the [Data Storage Service][CORTEX Data Storage Service]. Data is stored within named collections; and can be quickly retrieved using known keys. Multiple collections can be created to segregate data. The API currently only supports Basic Authorisation (but will be expanded to include OAuth2 authentication in future releases).

Currently, the [Data Storage Service][CORTEX Data Storage Service] can only be accessed by an API call (i.e. a 3rd party system, or a flow using the [Execute Http Request][] block to call the API Gateway endpoint). Dedicated blocks will be provided to interact with this service in a future release.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][CORTEX API Gateway Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Data Storage Service][CORTEX Data Storage Service]

===> WE STOPPED HERE

##### New Authorisation Service

The [Authorisation Service][CORTEX Authorisation Service] has been introduced to the HA Platform, the new service is responsible for Basic Authorisation and introduces OAuth2 authentication within the API Gateway Service (currently only available for the execution of flows in published packages, but will be expanded in future releases).

The following features of OAuth are currently implemented:

* Password/Grant type
* Authentication against a single Active Directory server
* Getting and refreshing OAuth tokens

An API is now available to:

* Authenticate using Basic Authorisation
* Authenticate using OAuth2, creating a new OAuth token
* Refresh expired OAuth tokens

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][CORTEX API Gateway Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Authorisation Service][CORTEX Authorisation Service]

#### Introduced OAuth2 Authorisation for Running Flows in Published Packages

With the introduction of the [Authorisation Service][CORTEX Authorisation Service], OAuth2 is now supported for the execution of flows in published packages (OAuth2 support will be expanded to include more APIs in future releases).

Package authorisation can be set or updated by using the {{% ctx %}} Gateway [Packages][] settings page, controlling who has access to start an execution of a flow for that package through OAuth2 authentication.
Authorisation settings can be managed through the new Authorisation tab added to the package definition view, which is visible when clicking on a specific package version.

Any changes made to the Authorisation settings of a package version are saved to source control, allowing for transparency and accountability. Authorisation settings are also persisted when creating a new version of a package and can be modified for each version independently.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][CORTEX Innovation Core Application]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][CORTEX API Gateway Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Authorisation Service][CORTEX Authorisation Service]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Package Management Service][CORTEX Package Management Service]
* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### New Blocks

Six new [Blocks][] have been added to the Innovation platform to work with:

* [Flows][] - Allowing for the execution of asynchronous flows, returning a task that can be waited for or cancelled at a later point in a flow
  * [Run Flow Async][]
* [Tasks][] - Including blocks that wait for a task to complete and then return the output of the task, or cancel a task that is currently running ending the execution of the task
  * [Wait For Task Block][]
  * [Wait For All Tasks Block][]
  * [Cancel Task Block][]
  * [Cancel All Tasks Block][]
* [Telnet][] - Allowing for connection to Telnet hosts, executing commands against them and returning their responses
  * [Execute Telnet Command][]

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### Improved Interaction Portal

The [Interaction Portal][] has been worked on to improve the general experience.
The areas that have been worked on are:

* Separation of packages that handles authentication, service requests, process executions and much more
* Refactoring of code within the packages; Including:
  * Reduced license count
  * Improved exception handling
  * Improved general consistency
* Overhaul of Manage Processes and Tasks and Process Dashboard
* Other general improvements

Affected Components:

* None

#### Improved Installation Process

Customer feedback has been addressed to improve the installation process of {{% ctx %}} Innovation, this includes improved validation when installing and more descriptive errors.

New parameters are now required for the installation of the Application Servers to configure the OAuth authorisation provider that is used by the new Authorisation Service.

Affected Components:

* None

#### Product Portal

The Product Portal has been rebranded to follow We Are {{% ctx %}} branding guidelines, the documentation has also been updated to reflect the [new and upcoming services][HA Platform], and reference documentation has also been added for the [new blocks][New Blocks].

Improvements have been made to the existing SSH documentation for the following data types:

* [SshLogs][]
* [SshSessionDetails][]

Affected Components:

* None

### Bug Fixes

There are no bug fixes as part of this release of the platform.

### Deprecated Features

The following features were previously deprecated in the 2022.9 release:

* SQL Server will no longer be required by [Gateway][] in a future release; this was targeted for removal in 2023.3 or 2023.5, but has been pushed out, currently targeting the 2024.1 release

The following feature has been deprecated in the 2023.5 release:

* The [Flow Debugger Service][CORTEX Flow Debugger Service] will be removed as the debugging capability is moving to the [Execution Service][CORTEX Execution Service]; this is targeted to be removed in 2023.7 or 2023.9 release

### Removed Features

#### Removed Introduction Video from Gateway Setup

The introduction video, which was available when first setting up {{% ctx %}} Gateway, has now been removed.

#### Removed Bundled Help from Gateway

The help documentation for the preview version of {{% ctx %}} Innovation, which was bundled with Gateway, has now been removed.

### Potential Breaking Changes

The following may potentially break interactions with the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform.

#### Problem Details Replace Exceptions in API Calls

Responses from [API Gateway][CORTEX API Gateway Service] now return [problem details][] instead of exceptions when an error occurs. [Problem details][] are returned in the response body in a machine-readable format, and allow for improved usability when interacting with errors returned by APIs.

This is potentially breaking if you were interacting with exceptions returned by any API call (i.e. a 3rd party system, or a flow using the [Execute Http Request][] block to call API Gateway endpoints). Any occurrence of this will need to be updated to use the [problem details] returned.

### Breaking Changes

There are no known breaking changes as part of this release of the platform.

### Known Limitations

Known limitations have been added within the 2023.5 release on the following pages:

* [Run Flow Async][Run Flow Async - Known Limitations]
