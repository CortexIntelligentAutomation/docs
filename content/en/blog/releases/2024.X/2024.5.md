### Features

#### Platform Visibility

##### Running Executions can be Stopped in Real-Time

The Package Management page within [Gateway][] that includes an overview of all executions running within the platform has been extended to allow for the stopping of running executions.

Executions can now be stopped by selecting an execution within the `Running Executions` tab and clicking the stop execution button, the grid will updated immediately removing the selected execution from the grid.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

##### Unselect All 'Use Latest Version' for a flow

Platform Visibility - Package Management - Unselect All 'Use Latest Version' for a flow (single select) - https://dev.azure.com/CortexIntelligentAutomation/Cortex/_workitems/edit/19248

#### Grafana Upgrades

  Platform Visibility - Observability - Upgrade components to use latest release versions https://dev.azure.com/CortexIntelligentAutomation/Cortex/_workitems/edit/18137

#### Extended Scope Support

TODO: Levels probably need expanding
Scope has been extended to support further levels of segregation, the levels within scope are hierarchical and allow for segregation at the following levels:

| Level   | ScopeOptions.All                              | ScopeOptions.Current                                        |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tenant  | All Tenants can access objects at this scope  | Only the specified Tenant can access objects at this scope  |
| System  | All Systems can access objects at this scope  | Only the specified System can access objects at this scope  |
| Package | All Packages can access objects at this scope | Only the specified Package can access objects at this scope |
| Flow    | All Flows can access objects at this scope    | Only the specified Flows can access objects at this scope   |

The following blocks have been updated to respect the new scope levels:

TODO: Add Block Links
* [Data]
  * [Create Collection][]
  * [Delete Collection][]
  * [Read Data with Key][]
  * [Write Data with Key][]
  * [Delete Data with Key][]
  * [Wait For Collection To Exist][]
  * [Wait For Collection To Not Exist][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Be Set][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Contain Value][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Exist][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Not Exist][]

Also, the [Semaphore property][] respects the new levels added to scope.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Authorisation Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Concurrency Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Configuration Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Data Storage Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Licence Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Package Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Provisioning Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Scheduling Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### New Blocks

Two new [Blocks][] have been added to the {{% ctx %}} platform to work with:

TODO: Pages/Links
* [Wireless][] - Allowing for the control and movement of tokens within a flow
  * [Wireless Sender][]
  * [Wireless Receiver][]

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### Improved Fingerprint Generator

The {{% ctx %}} Licence Fingerprint Generator has been updated to remove its usage from the [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][] and the [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][] in order to reduce the usage of the fingerprint mechanisms within the platform. Now, the [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][] and the [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][] interact with an executable {{% ctx %}} Licence Fingerprint Generator which means the fingerprint generation logic has ben consolidated to a single location.

Also, the installation has been improved to copy the required {{% ctx %}} Licence Fingerprint Generator executable to the correct location on all specified nodes when installing the {{% ctx %}} Platform.

#### Improved {{% ctx %}} Gateway

CORTEX Gateway - Help Link should update local config file after upgrading https://dev.azure.com/CortexIntelligentAutomation/Cortex/_workitems/edit/18143
CORTEX Studio - Fix setup wizard in light and dark mode to be consistent with rest of restyle https://dev.azure.com/CortexIntelligentAutomation/Cortex/_workitems/edit/19266

#### Improved {{% ctx %}} Gateway

Flow Engine - Exceptions - Add HelpLink sentence to exceptions without https://dev.azure.com/CortexIntelligentAutomation/Cortex/_workitems/edit/18691
Flow Engine - Exceptions - OutputPortNotConnectedException - Add HelpLink sentence to exception message https://dev.azure.com/CortexIntelligentAutomation/Cortex/_workitems/edit/18269
Flow Engine - Exceptions - Correct RuntimeTranslationException message https://dev.azure.com/CortexIntelligentAutomation/Cortex/_workitems/edit/18727  

#### Improved Installation

The installation process of the {{% ctx %}} Platform has been improved in the following ways:

* SANs within Autogenerated Self Signed Certificate now include the machine names and IP addresses of all application servers
* SkipLoadBalancer parameter has been removed, the installation steps for the Load Balancer is skipped if the LoadBalancerIpAddress parameter does not contain a value
* A new configuration file named `Cortex.Upgrade.ApplicationConfig.Json` will be generated after performing an installation, this file is be used to configure perform upgrades of the {{% ctx %}} Platform
* Documentation was improved to list all service log locations that would be useful when checking for errors

Affected Components:

* {{% ctx %}} App Server Install Scripts
* {{% ctx %}} Web App Server Install Scripts

#### Improved Upgrade

The upgrade process of the {{% ctx %}} Platform has been improved in the following ways:

* All app settings will now be preserved after the upgrade has been run (Note: If a setting is present in the backed up configuration and not present in the new configuration, then it will not be carried forward with the upgrade)
* If the new configuration file named `Cortex.Upgrade.ApplicationConfig.Json` is present when upgrading, the settings and configuration present within the file will be used to perform the upgrade and then updated and recorded for future upgrades within the same `Cortex.Upgrade.ApplicationConfig.Json` file
* Output generated by the upgrade scripts has been improved

Affected Components:

* {{% ctx %}} App Server Install Scripts
* {{% ctx %}} Web App Server Install Scripts

#### Product Portal

This Product Portal includes updates related to:

* The [new blocks][New Blocks] and data types
* [Exceptions][] and [Data Types][] that were marked as Work In Progress
* The [improved installation][]
* The [improved upgrade][]
