### Features

#### Package Management

##### Running Executions can be Stopped in Real-Time

The Package Management page within [Gateway][] that includes an overview of all executions running within the platform has been extended to allow for the stopping of running executions.

Executions can now be stopped by selecting an execution within the `Running Executions` tab and clicking the stop execution button, the grid will updated immediately removing the selected execution from the grid.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

##### Unselect 'Use Latest Version' for All Flows Except for a Selected One

New functionality has been introduced when creating a new version of an existing package. Users can now easily unselect all flows that are ticked for the 'Use Latest Version' column, except the selected flow. This allows for creating new versions of packages quickly that patch a single flow.

In order to unselect all flows except the selected flow, the user needs to right-click on the 'Use Latest Version ' cell for the flow they want and click `Unselect all except this flow` option within the context menu, which will then unselect all other flows that had 'Use Latest Version' selected.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### Extended Scope Support

Scope has been extended to support further levels of segregation, the levels within scope are hierarchical and allow for segregation at the following levels:

| Level   | ScopeOptions.All                              | ScopeOptions.Current                                        |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tenant  | All Tenants can access objects at this scope  | Only the specified Tenant can access objects at this scope  |
| System  | All Systems can access objects at this scope  | Only the specified System can access objects at this scope  |
| Package | All Packages can access objects at this scope | Only the specified Package can access objects at this scope |
| Flow    | All Flows can access objects at this scope    | Only the specified Flows can access objects at this scope   |

The following blocks have been updated to respect the new scope levels:

* [Data Storage][]
  * [Create Collection][]
  * [Delete Collection][]
  * [Read Data with Key][]
  * [Write Data with Key][]
  * [Delete Data with Key][]
  * [Wait For Collection To Exist][]
  * [Wait For Collection To Not Exist][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Be Set][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Contain Value][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Exist][]
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Not Exist][]

Also, the [Semaphore property][] respects the new levels added to scope.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Authorisation Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Concurrency Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Configuration Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Data Storage Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Licence Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Package Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Provisioning Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Scheduling Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### New Blocks

Two new [Blocks][] have been added, allowing for better organisation of the layout of a flow:

* [Wireless Sender][]
* [Wireless Receiver][]

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### Reduced Usage of Shared Fingerprint Generator Code

Services within the {% ctx %} platform no longer reference code shared with the {{% ctx %}} Licence Fingerprint Generator, and now invoke a local instance of the {{% ctx %}} Licence Fingerprint Generator when validating licenses, this means that the only tool interacting with components to generate fingerprints is the {{% ctx %}} Licence Fingerprint Generator.

Also, the installation has been improved to copy the required {{% ctx %}} Licence Fingerprint Generator executable to the correct location on all specified nodes when installing the {{% ctx %}} Platform.

#### Improved {{% ctx %}} Gateway

##### Helplinks Update When Upgrading the {{% ctx %}} Platform

Previously, configuration for helplinks provided within gateway would not be updated when upgrading the {{% ctx %}} platform, now helplink configuration will be updated to generate links correctly.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

##### Update Styling of the Setup Wizard to be Consistent with New Themes

The setup wizard presented when first installing [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway] has been updated to honour the Light and Dark themes.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### Improved Engine Exceptions

A number of exceptions that can be generated by the flow engine have been improved:

TODO: Check if links to pages exist

* The OutputPortNotConnectedException message has been improved to include a helplink to the relevant documentation
* The RuntimeTranslationException message has been improved to provide more clarity in the error raised by the engine and how to fix the error

Any related documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### Improved Installation

The installation process of the {{% ctx %}} Platform has been improved in the following ways:

* A new configuration file named `Cortex.Upgrade.ApplicationConfig.Json` will be generated after performing an installation, this file will save configuration settings related to the installation and will be used to simplify upgrades in a future release.

Affected Components:

* {{% ctx %}} App Server Install Scripts
* {{% ctx %}} Web App Server Install Scripts

#### Improved Upgrade

The upgrade process of the {{% ctx %}} Platform has been improved in the following ways:

* If the `Cortex.Upgrade.ApplicationConfig.Json` file is not present when upgrading, then all parameters must be configured when using the upgrade script
* If the `Cortex.Upgrade.ApplicationConfig.Json` file is present when upgrading, then no parameters need to be configured when using the upgrade script; the configuration settings will be used to perform the upgrade
  * If parameters are passed to the upgrade script these will used and overwrite the corresponding configuration settings within the `Cortex.Upgrade.ApplicationConfig.Json` file
* Output generated by the upgrade script has been improved

Affected Components:

* {{% ctx %}} App Server Install Scripts
* {{% ctx %}} Web App Server Install Scripts

#### Observability Upgrades

Grafana, Loki, and Promtail have been updated to the latest major versions, all related documentation and screenshots has been updated to reflect these changes.

* Grafana - 10.4.1
* Loki - 3.0.0
* Promtail - 3.0.0

Affected Components:

* Grafana
* Loki
* Promtail

#### Product Portal

This Product Portal includes updates related to:

* The [new blocks][New Blocks] and data types
* The [improved installation][]
* The [improved upgrade][]

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed in the 2024.5 release of the {{% ctx %}} Platform:

#### Blocks

TODO: Links

##### FormatException Message has the Incorrect Format

Previously, the [FormatException] message would show an incorrect parameter index, this has now been fixed.

##### Semaphore Property not showing on Run Flow and Run Flow Async blocks

Previously, the [semaphore property] was not displayed on the Run Flow Block and the Run Flow Async Block, this has now been fixed and the semaphore property is now displayed.

##### Execute Data Command Block would not Cancel

Previously, the [Execute Data Command Block] would not cancel. If it was stopped during a long running command the execution would become unresponsive; this has now been fixed and the Execute Data Command Block stops when the block timeout is reached or the flow is stopped.

##### Execute Data Command Block would not Close Connections when an Exception Occurred

Previously, when the [Execute Data Command Block] threw an exception it would leave connections to the data source open when the close connection property was set to `true`; this has now been fixed and the connection closes.

#### Engine

##### Reduce Memory usage for large flows

Previously, large flows used to have an issue where they could cause memory usage to increase; this has now been reduced and memory usage has been made more stable.

##### Incorrect Result in Mathematical Operation with int32 Variables

Previously, when using int32 variables in mathematical operations, some operations would be incorrect due to the int32 range; this has now been fixed to throw an OverflowException when an underflow or overflow occurs.

##### Variables don't get disposed when flows stop

Previously, when an execution is stopped, variables which were not an input or output variable would not be disposed; this has now been fixed.

### Deprecated Features

There are no features deprecated as part of the 2024.5 release of the {{% ctx %}} Platform.

### Removed Features

There are no features removed in the 2024.5 release of the {{% ctx %}} Platform.

### Potential Breaking Changes

The following features have introduced potentially breaking changes in the 2024.5 release of the {{% ctx %}} Platform:

#### Extended Scope Support

The following features have changed any block property that used the [Scope][] data type:

* [Extended Scope Support][]

All flows that use the scope property will need to be upgraded using the {{% ctx %}} Flows Upgrader.

Any flow not upgraded using this tool will need to be edited, saved, and committed in {{% ctx %}} Gateway otherwise they cannot be published in a new package or new version of a package. Using the {{% ctx %}} Flows Upgrader on all flows is recommended to reduce any manual input required to get flows into a publishable state.
