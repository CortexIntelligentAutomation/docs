### Features

#### Platform Visibility

##### Running Executions can be Stopped in Real-Time

The Package Management page within [Gateway][] that includes an overview of all executions running within the platform has been extended to allow for the stopping of running executions.

Executions can now be stopped by selecting an execution within the `Running Executions` tab and clicking the stop execution button, the grid will updated immediately removing the selected execution from the grid.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

##### Unselect All 'Use Latest Version' for a flow

New functionality has been introduced when creating a new version of an existing package. Users can now easily unselect all flows that are ticked for the 'Use Latest Version' column, except the selected flow. This allows for creating new versions of packages quickly that patch a single flow.

In order to unselect all flows except the selected flow, the user needs to right-click on the 'Use Latest Version ' cell for the flow they want and click `Unselect all except this flow` option within the context menu, which will then unselect all other flows that had 'Use Latest Version' selected.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### Grafana Upgrades

Grafana, Loki, and Promtail have been updated to the latest major versions, all related documentation and screenshots has been updated to reflect these changes.

Affected Components:

* Grafana
* Loki
* Promtail

#### Extended Scope Support

TODO: Levels probably need expanding
Scope has been extended to support further levels of segregation, the levels within scope are hierarchical and allow for segregation at the following levels:

| Level   | ScopeOptions.All                              | ScopeOptions.Current                                        |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tenant  | All Tenants can access objects at this scope  | Only the specified Tenant can access objects at this scope  |
| System  | All Systems can access objects at this scope  | Only the specified System can access objects at this scope  |
| Package | All Packages can access objects at this scope | Only the specified Package can access objects at this scope |
| Flow    | All Flows can access objects at this scope    | Only the specified Flows can access objects at this scope   |

The following blocks have been updated to respect the new scope levels:

TODO: Add Block Links
* [Data]
  * [Create Collection]: {{< url path="Cortex.Reference.Blocks.DataStorage.CreateCollection.CreateCollectionBlock.MainDoc" version="2024.5" >}}
  * [Delete Collection]: {{< url path="Cortex.Reference.Blocks.DataStorage.DeleteCollection.DeleteCollectionBlock.MainDoc" version="2024.5" >}}
  * [Read Data with Key]: {{< url path="Cortex.Reference.Blocks.DataStorage.ReadData.ReadDataWithKeyBlock.MainDoc" version="2024.5" >}}
  * [Write Data with Key]: {{< url path="Cortex.Reference.Blocks.DataStorage.WriteData.WriteDataWithKeyBlock.MainDoc" version="2024.5" >}}
  * [Delete Data with Key]: {{< url path="Cortex.Reference.Blocks.DataStorage.DeleteData.DeleteDataWithKeyBlock.MainDoc" version="2024.5" >}}
  * [Wait For Collection To Exist]: {{< url path="Cortex.Reference.Blocks.DataStorage.WaitForCollection.WaitForCollectionToExistBlock.MainDoc" version="2024.5" >}}
  * [Wait For Collection To Not Exist]: {{< url path="Cortex.Reference.Blocks.DataStorage.WaitForCollection.WaitForCollectionToNotExistBlock.MainDoc" version="2024.5" >}}
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Be Set]: {{< url path="Cortex.Reference.Blocks.DataStorage.WaitForKeyInCollection.WaitForKeyInCollectionToBeSetBlock.MainDoc" version="2024.5" >}}
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Contain Value]: {{< url path="Cortex.Reference.Blocks.DataStorage.WaitForKeyInCollection.WaitForKeyInCollectionToContainValueBlock.MainDoc" version="2024.5" >}}
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Exist]: {{< url path="Cortex.Reference.Blocks.DataStorage.WaitForKeyInCollection.WaitForKeyInCollectionToExistBlock.MainDoc" version="2024.5" >}}
  * [Wait For Key In Collection To Not Exist]: {{< url path="Cortex.Reference.Blocks.DataStorage.WaitForKeyInCollection.WaitForKeyInCollectionToNotExistBlock.MainDoc" version="2024.5" >}}

Also, the [Semaphore property]: {{< url path="Cortex.Reference.Concepts.Fundamentals.Blocks.BlockProperties.CommonProperties.SemaphoreProperty" version="2024.5" >}} respects the new levels added to scope.

#### New Blocks

Two new [Blocks][] have been added to the {{% ctx %}} platform to work with:

TODO: Pages/Links
* [Wireless][] - Allowing for the control and movement of tokens within a flow
  * [Wireless Sender][]
  * [Wireless Receiver][]

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### Improved Fingerprint Generator

The {{% ctx %}} Licence Fingerprint Generator has been updated to remove its usage from the [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][] and the [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][] in order to reduce the usage of the fingerprint mechanisms within the platform. Now, the [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][] and the [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][] interact with an executable {{% ctx %}} Licence Fingerprint Generator which means the fingerprint generation logic has ben consolidated to a single location.

Also, the installation has been improved to copy the required {{% ctx %}} Licence Fingerprint Generator executable to the correct location on all specified nodes when installing the {{% ctx %}} Platform.

#### Improved {{% ctx %}} Gateway

##### Helplinks Update When Upgrading the {{% ctx %}} Platform

Previously, configuration for helplinks provided within gateway would not be updated when upgrading the {{% ctx %}} platform, now helplink configuration will be updated to generate links correctly.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

##### Update Styling of the Setup Wizard to be Consistent with Improved Design

The setup wizard presented when first installing [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway] has been improved and overhauled to match the new design introduced inm previous versions of the {{% ctx %}} platform. The Setup Wizard also allows for both Light and Dark themes.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### Engine Exceptions Improvements

A number of exceptions that can be generated by the flow engine have been improved:

* The OutputPortNotConnectedException message has been improved to include a helplink to the relevant documentation
* The RuntimeTranslationException message has been improved to provide more clarity in the error raised by the engine and how to fix the error

Any related documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### Improved Installation

The installation process of the {{% ctx %}} Platform has been improved in the following ways:

* SANs within Autogenerated Self Signed Certificate now include the machine names and IP addresses of all application servers
* SkipLoadBalancer parameter has been removed, the installation steps for the Load Balancer is skipped if the LoadBalancerIpAddress parameter does not contain a value
* A new configuration file named `Cortex.Upgrade.ApplicationConfig.Json` will be generated after performing an installation, this file is be used to configure perform upgrades of the {{% ctx %}} Platform
* Documentation was improved to list all service log locations that would be useful when checking for errors

Affected Components:

* {{% ctx %}} App Server Install Scripts
* {{% ctx %}} Web App Server Install Scripts

#### Improved Upgrade

The upgrade process of the {{% ctx %}} Platform has been improved in the following ways:

* All app settings will now be preserved after the upgrade has been run (Note: If a setting is present in the backed up configuration and not present in the new configuration, then it will not be carried forward with the upgrade)
* If the new configuration file named `Cortex.Upgrade.ApplicationConfig.Json` is present when upgrading, the settings and configuration present within the file will be used to perform the upgrade and then updated and recorded for future upgrades within the same `Cortex.Upgrade.ApplicationConfig.Json` file
* Output generated by the upgrade scripts has been improved

Affected Components:

* {{% ctx %}} App Server Install Scripts
* {{% ctx %}} Web App Server Install Scripts

#### Product Portal

This Product Portal includes updates related to:

* The [new blocks][New Blocks] and data types
* [Exceptions][] and [Data Types][] that were marked as Work In Progress
* The [improved installation][]
* The [improved upgrade][]

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed in the 2024.5 release of the {{% ctx %}} Platform:

#### Blocks

##### FormatException Message has the Incorrect Format

Previously, the FormatException message would show an incorrect parameter index, this has now been fixed.

##### Semaphore Property not showing on Run Flow and Run Flow Async blocks

Previously, the semaphore property was not displayed on the Run Flow Block and the Run Flow Async Block, this has now been fixed and the semaphore property is now displayed.

##### Block Timeout Failure causes flow execution to become unresponsive

Previously, the Execute Data Command Block would not cancel if it was stopped during a long running command the execution would become unresponsive, this has now been fixed and the Execute Data Command Block stops when it times out or the flow is stopped during a long running command.

##### Pooled connection request timed out
