##### Configurable Logging within the HA Platform

An API route has been added to API Gateway which allows for configuration of logging accross the entire {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform. All logs are written at a given `LogLevel`, and the current `LogLevel` of the application can be changed and updated at runtime.

Any logs with a `LogLevel` lower than the configured `LogLevel` for the platform will not be logged. Information regarding the types of logs and can be found below:

| `LogLevel`                   | Service Logs at this `LogLevel`                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LogLevel.Trace` (`0`)       | None                                                                                                                                        |
| `LogLevel.Debug` (`1`)       | Logs written when: a message is handled successfully, an event is handled successfully, a flow is stopped or completes successfully         |
| `LogLevel.Information` (`2`) | None                                                                                                                                        |
| `LogLevel.Warning` (`3`)     | None                                                                                                                                        |
| `LogLevel.Error` (`4`)       | Logs written when: a message raises an unhandled exception, an event raises an unhandled exception, a flow ends with an unhandled exception |
| `LogLevel.Critical` (`5`)    | None                                                                                                                                        |

If a `LogLevel` above `LogLevel.Critical` (`5`) is provided, then logging across the platform will be disabled.

Note: API Logging cannot currently be configured, and will always write logs when requests to the [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][] are received, this may change in a future release.

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed in the 2024.1 release of the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform:

#### Installation

##### Execution Service UsingSelfSignedCertificates setting needs updating

TODO: https://dev.azure.com/CortexIntelligentAutomation/Cortex/_backlogs/backlog/Team%203/Epics?System.Tags=2024.1&workitem=14502

Previously When installing {{% ctx %}} Gateway, the installation script could error with `"The request to add or remove features on the specified server failed"`. The {{% ctx %}} Gateway installation script now installs RSAT-AD-PowerShell in order to resolve this.

##### Execution service gateway certificate settings need setting for self signed

TODO:
https://dev.azure.com/CortexIntelligentAutomation/Cortex/_backlogs/backlog/All%20Teams/Epics?showParents=true&System.Tags=2024.1&workitem=14405

##### PowerShellSessionDetails saved to Reliable Collection - Port (Int32) returned as Int64

TODO:
https://dev.azure.com/CortexIntelligentAutomation/Cortex/_backlogs/backlog/All%20Teams/Epics?showParents=true&System.Tags=2024.1&workitem=14832
Previously, if a execution is running and waiting on a [Wait for Key in Collection to be Set][] block, the execution would continue when a [Wait for Key in Collection to Exist][] or [Wait for Key in Collection to Contain Value][] block was executed in another execution, the state of these blocks should have been independent.

TODO https://dev.azure.com/CortexIntelligentAutomation/Cortex/_backlogs/backlog/All%20Teams/Epics?showParents=true&System.Tags=2024.1&workitem=14349

#### Execution Service

##### Memory Usage Increases when Running Flows that Loop for a Large Number of Iterations

Previously, memory usage would increase over time when an executed flow would loop for a large number of iterations, this has been fixed and memory remains stable when looping in this manner.

#### Gateway

##### 'Enter' button should submit form

TODO:

Previously, when navigating to a flow that was unavailable with Dark Mode enabled, the text displaying the reason was the same colour as the background making it unreadable.
