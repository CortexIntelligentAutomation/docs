## Release Notes

### Overview

2024.1 is the first [Release][] of the next generation of {{% ctx %}} and continues our journey to improve on the previous 7.X generation in the following areas:

* Capability
* Security
* Observability
* Documentation

The dependency on SQL Server has been [removed][removal of SQL Server] from [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway].

Logging within the [HA Platform][] has been improved in a number of ways:

* All services have had [improved logging introduced][] to capture when they receive messages or events, to provide insight and traceability throughout the {{% ctx %}}  Platform. Also, additional logging has been introduced into the Execution Service to log all flows and any called flows, including input variables, output variables, and whether the flow had finished successfully or threw an unhandled exception
* An API route has been added to API Gateway which allows for [configuration of logging][] across the entire {{% ctx %}} Platform. All logs are written at a given `LogLevel`, and the current `LogLevel` of the application can be changed and updated at runtime
* [The maximum number of log files a service can produce has been reduced][reduced log size], each service will store a maximum of 365 individual log files, rolling over if they reach a file size limit

A number of [blocks have been improved][Improved Blocks] within the [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks], improving functionality to work with:

* [Text][] - Allowing for searching for values within text, using a number of methods e.g. Literal Text, Pattern Matching, and Regex, and then either replacing or removing the found text

The [installation process of the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform has been improved][improved installation] in a number of ways, such as:

* Making the load balancer more secure
* Autogenerated self signed certificates are now generated with SANs
* Removal of hard coded drive paths
* Updated to reflect the [removal of SQL Server][].

Various 3rd party client libraries within [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway] have been [upgraded][] - this provides any associated improvements, such as:

* Security
* Memory utilisation
* Performance

Finally, this [Product Portal][] includes updated documentation for the [improved blocks][Improved Blocks], and the [improved installation][].

### Features

#### Remove Dependency on SQL Server

The dependency on SQL Server has been [removed][Removed - SQL Server Dependency] from [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway].

On upgrade from a previous version of the {{% ctx %}} Platform, migration will be performed automatically to migrate data from the existing SQL Server Databases to git repositories.

The Cortex.Web.Auth database will automatically be deleted, and the Cortex.Web database will have all tables removes except those required for {{% ctx %}} 7 LiveView and Reporting components. If LiveView and Reporting are not used, the Cortex.Web database can be manually deleted.

Note: The dependency on SQL Server does not affect which databases the {{% ctx %}} Platform can interact with. Interaction with a SQL Server data connection is still supported within flows.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### Expansion of the HA Platform

##### Improved Logging within the HA Platform

All services have had improved logging introduced to capture when they receive messages or events, to provide insight and traceability throughout the {{% ctx %}}  Platform.

Also, additional logging has been introduced into the Execution Service to log all flows and any called flows, including input variables, output variables, and whether the flow had finished successfully or threw an unhandled exception

All new structured logs contain the following shared details:

##### Configurable Logging within the HA Platform

An API route has been added to API Gateway which allows for configuration of logging accross the entire {{% ctx %}} Platform. All logs are written at a given `LogLevel`, and the current `LogLevel` of the application can be changed and updated at runtime.

Any logs with a `LogLevel` lower than the configured `LogLevel` for the platform will not be logged. Information regarding the types of log level and what logs are written at a given level can be found below:

| Log Level                                  | Service Logs at this LogLevel                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <nobr>`LogLevel.Trace` (`0`) </nobr>       | None                                                                                                                                        |
| <nobr>`LogLevel.Debug` (`1`) </nobr>       | Logs written when: a message is handled successfully, an event is handled successfully, a flow is stopped or completes successfully         |
| <nobr>`LogLevel.Information` (`2`) </nobr> | None                                                                                                                                        |
| <nobr>`LogLevel.Warning` (`3`) </nobr>     | None                                                                                                                                        |
| <nobr>`LogLevel.Error` (`4`) </nobr>       | Logs written when: a message raises an unhandled exception, an event raises an unhandled exception, a flow ends with an unhandled exception |
| <nobr>`LogLevel.Critical` (`5`) </nobr>    | None                                                                                                                                        |

If a Log Level above `LogLevel.Critical` (`5`) is provided, then logging across the platform will be disabled.

Note: API Logging cannot currently be configured, and will always write logs when requests to the [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][] are received, this may change in a future release.

#### Improved Blocks

The following [Blocks][] have been improved as part of this release of the platform:

* [Text][] - Allowing for searching for values within text, using a number of methods e.g. Literal Text, Pattern Matching, and Regex, and then either replacing or removing the found text
  * [Find And Replace Text][]
  * [Find And Replace All Text][]
  * [Find And Remove Text][]
  * [Find And Remove All Text][]

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### Improved Installation

The installation process of the {{% ctx %}} Platform has been improved in the following ways:

* The load balancer now uses basic auth for the preinstalled gobetween API, and TLS has been added to this API to improve security
* The load balancer now uses the same certificate as the application servers, providing increased security when communicating with the platform
* Autogenerated self signed certificates are now generated with SANs - the SANs included are: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and wildcard domain (e.g. `*.domain.com`)
* The installation scripts have been updated to remove references to hard coded drive paths, and now use environment paths
* The installation scripts have been updated to reflect the changes to the platform due to the [removal of the dependency on SQL Server][removal of SQL Server]

Affected Components:

* {{% ctx %}} App Server Install Scripts
* {{% ctx %}} Web App Server Install Scripts

#### Upgrade 3rd Party Client Libraries

Various 3rd party client libraries within [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway] have been upgraded - this provides any associated improvements, such as:

* Security
* Memory utilisation
* Performance

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### Product Portal

Reference documentation has been updated for the [improved blocks][Improved Blocks] and related data types, and the documentation has been updated to reflect the [improved installation][] and [removal of SQL Server][].

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed in the 2024.1 release of the {{% ctx %}} Platform:

#### Installation

##### UsingSelfSignedCertificates Setting within the Execution Service was not Updated Correctly During Installation

Previously when running the installation script the service settings for the [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][] UsingSelfSignedCertificates was not updated correctly. The {{% ctx %}} application installation script now updates this property correctly.

#### Data Storage

##### When PowerShellSessionDetails was Retrieved from a Reliable Collection the Port returned as Int64 instead of Int32

Previously, when any PowerShellSessionDetails were retrieved from a Reliable Collection the port returned as Int64 instead of Int32, this has been fixed and property types are maintained when reading data from a reliable collection.

#### Blocks

##### Text Blocks - TextToFind Input Property is Modified During a Flow when SearchOptions is set to LiteralText or PatternMatching

Previously, the TextToFind input property was modified if the SearchOptions were set to either `LiteralText` or `PatternMatching`, this no longer occurs when running any block that uses TextToFind.

##### SSH Blocks - RegexMatchTimeoutException Thrown when Large Output was Returned by the Client

Previously, when a large quantity of text was returned by the SSH client, a RegexMatchTimeoutException would be thrown by the block. The default regex within the TerminalPrompt has been optimised and improved to prevent backtracking.

#### API Gateway Service

##### Converting Certain JSON causes High CPU on API Gateway

Previously, when a large quantity of text was processed by the [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][] CPU would heavily increase, this was due to backtracking when redacting sensitive information from logs, the redaction has now been optimised and improved to remove this backtracking and reduce its impact on performance.

#### Triggers Service

##### Triggers Service Cannot Upgrade Due to Port Conflicts

Previously, when upgrading the [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][] a port conflict could occur causing the upgrade to fail and roll back, this no longer occurs.

##### Discard Input Variable Breaks Contract

Previously, if a trigger was created with no input variables then an error would occur when the trigger ran the flow. Triggers can now be created with no input variables.

#### Execution Service

##### Memory Usage Increases when Running Flows that Loop for a Large Number of Iterations

Previously, memory usage would increase over time when an executed flow would loop for a large number of iterations, this has been fixed and memory remains stable when looping in this manner.

#### Gateway

##### 'Enter' Button Stopped Acting as a Submit Action for Forms

Previously, the 'Enter' key has stopped acting as an action to submit a form within gateway, this has been fixed.

### Deprecated Features

There are no features deprecated as part of the 2024.1 release of the {{% ctx %}} Platform.

### Removed Features

The following features have been removed in the 2024.1 release of the {{% ctx %}} Platform:

#### SQL Server Dependency

* SQL Server will no longer be required by [Gateway][], the [installation and documentation has been improved][Improved Installation] to reflect this and no longer requires SQL Server.

Note: If you are adding {{% ctx %}} to a {{% ctx %}} 7 Installation, then SQL Server is still required due to the requirements of the {{% ctx %}} 7 platform.

### Potential Breaking Changes

The following features are potentially breaking changes in the 2024.1 release of the {{% ctx %}} Platform:

#### Improved Blocks

The [improved blocks][] may cause flows that use them to stop working, due to the changes to the properties of the blocks. Any flow containing these blocks can be fixed by deleting and replacing the block.

### Breaking Changes

There are no known breaking changes as part of the 2024.1 release of the {{% ctx %}} Platform.

### Known Limitations

The following known limitations have been added as part of the 2024.1 release of the {{% ctx %}} Platform:

* [Find And Replace Text][Find and Replace Text Limitations]
* [Find And Replace All Text][Find and Replace All Text Limitations]
* [Find And Remove Text][Find and Remove Text Limitations]
* [Find And Remove All Text][Find and Remove All Text Limitations]
