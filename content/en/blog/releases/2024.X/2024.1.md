## Release Notes

### Overview

2024.1 is the first [Release][] of the next generation of {{% ctx %}} and continues our journey to improve on the previous 7.X generation in the following areas:

TODO:

* Capability
* Security
* Documentation

Logging within the [HA Platform][] has been improved in a number of ways:

* All services have had [improved logging introduced][] to capture when they receive messages or events, in order to provide insight and traceability throughout the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform. Also, Flow Logging has been introduced to the Execution Service, and allows for the logging of all flows and any called flows, reporting the state in which the flow finished
* An API route has been added to API Gateway which allows for [configuration of logging][] across the entire {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform. All logs are written at a given `LogLevel`, and the current `LogLevel` of the application can be changed and updated at runtime
* [The maximum number of log files a service can produce has been reduced][], each service will store a maximum of 365 individual log files, rolling over if they reach a file size limit.

Dependency on SQL Server has been removed from all remaining views in line with the [removal of SQL Server][].

A number of [blocks have been improved][Improved Blocks] within the the [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks], improving new functionality to work with:

* [Text][] - Allowing for searching for values within text, using a number of methods e.g. Contains Text, Pattern Matching, and Regex, and then either replacing or removing the found text

The [installation process of the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform has been improved][improved installation] in a number of ways, such as: making the load balancer more secure, autogenerated self signed certificates are now generated with SANs, removal of hard coded drive paths, and updates to reflect the [removal of SQL Server][]

The dependency on AngluerJS within [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway] has been upgraded - this provides any associated improvements to security, memory utilisation and performance.

{{% ctx %}} Gateway [rebranding][{{% ctx %}} Gateway Rebranding] has continued to add further support for the light and dark themes introduced in the 2023.9 release.

Finally, this [Product Portal][] includes updated documentation for the [improved blocks][Improved Blocks], and the [improved installation][].

##### Configurable Logging within the HA Platform

An API route has been added to API Gateway which allows for configuration of logging accross the entire {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform. All logs are written at a given `LogLevel`, and the current `LogLevel` of the application can be changed and updated at runtime.

Any logs with a `LogLevel` lower than the configured `LogLevel` for the platform will not be logged. Information regarding the types of logs and can be found below:

| `LogLevel`                   | Service Logs at this `LogLevel`                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `LogLevel.Trace` (`0`)       | None                                                                                                                                        |
| `LogLevel.Debug` (`1`)       | Logs written when: a message is handled successfully, an event is handled successfully, a flow is stopped or completes successfully         |
| `LogLevel.Information` (`2`) | None                                                                                                                                        |
| `LogLevel.Warning` (`3`)     | None                                                                                                                                        |
| `LogLevel.Error` (`4`)       | Logs written when: a message raises an unhandled exception, an event raises an unhandled exception, a flow ends with an unhandled exception |
| `LogLevel.Critical` (`5`)    | None                                                                                                                                        |

If a `LogLevel` above `LogLevel.Critical` (`5`) is provided, then logging across the platform will be disabled.

Note: API Logging cannot currently be configured, and will always write logs when requests to the [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][] are received, this may change in a future release.

TODO: Migrations

Note: The dependency on SQL 

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### Improved Blocks

The following [Blocks][] have been improved as part of this release of the the Innovation platform:

* [Text][] - Allowing for searching for values within text, using a number of methods e.g. Contains Text, Pattern Matching, and Regex, and then either replacing or removing the found text
  * [Find And Replace Text][]
  * [Find And Replace All Text][]
  * [Find And Remove Text][]
  * [Find And Remove All Text][]

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### Improved Installation

The installation process of the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform has been improved in the following ways:

* The load balancer now uses basic auth for the preinstalled gobetween API, and TLS has been added to this API to improve security
* The Load Balancer now uses the same certificate as the application servers, providing increased security when communicating with the platform
* Autogenerated self signed certificates are now generated with SANs - the SANs included are: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and wildcard domain (e.g. `*.domain.com`)
* The installation scripts have been updated to remove references to hard coded drive paths, and now use environment paths
* The installation scripts have been updated to reflect the changes to the platform due to the [removal of the dependency on SQL Server][removal of SQL Server]

Affected Components:

* None

#### Upgrade AngularJS

The dependency on AngluerJS within [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway] has been upgraded - this provides any associated improvements to security, memory utilisation and performance.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### CORTEX Gateway Rebranding

The themes in {{% ctx %}} Gateway have had minor improvements applied based on user feedback.

### Bug Fixes

The following bugs have been fixed in the 2024.1 release of the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform:

#### Installation

##### UsingSelfSignedCertificates setting within the Execution Service was not updated correctly during installation

Previously when running the installation script the service settings for the [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][] UsingSelfSignedCertificates was not updated correctly. The {{% ctx %}} application installation script now updates this property correctly.

#### Data Storage

##### When PowerShellSessionDetails was retrieved from a Reliable Collection the port returned as Int64 instead of Int32

Previously, when any PowerShellSessionDetails were retrieved from a Reliable Collection the port returned as Int64 instead of Int32, this has been fixed and property types are maintained when reading data from a reliable collection.

#### Blocks

##### Text Blocks - TextToFind Input property is modified in flow when SearchOptions is set to ContainsText or PatternMatching

Previously, the TextToFind input property was modified if the SearchOptions were set to either `ContainsText` or `PatternMatching`, this no longer occurs when running any block that uses TextToFind. 

##### SSH Blocks - RegexMatchTimeoutException thrown when Large Output was Returned by the Client

Previously, when a large quantity of text was returned by the ssh client, a RegexMatchTimeoutException would be thrown by the block. The default regex within the TerminalPrompt has been optimised and improved to prevent backtracking.

#### API Gateway Service

##### Converting certain JSON causes high CPU on API Gateway

Previously, when a large quantity of text was processed by the [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][] CPU would heavily increase, this was due to backtracking when redacting sensitive information from logs, the redaction has now been optimised and improved to remove this backtracking and reduce its impact on performance.

#### Triggers Service

##### Triggers Service cannot upgrade because due to port conflicts

Previously, when upgrading the [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][] a port conflict could occur causing the upgrade to fail and roll back, this no longer occurs.

##### Discard Input Variable breaks contract

Previously, if a trigger was created with no input variables then an error would occur when the trigger ran the flow. Triggers can now be created with no input variables.

#### Execution Service

##### Memory Usage Increases when Running Flows that Loop for a Large Number of Iterations

Previously, memory usage would increase over time when an executed flow would loop for a large number of iterations, this has been fixed and memory remains stable when looping in this manner.

#### Gateway

##### 'Enter' Button Stopped Acting as a Submit Action for Forms

Previously, the 'Enter' key has stopped acting as an action to submit a form within gateway.

### Deprecated Features

There are no features deprecated as part of the 2024.1 release of the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform.

### Removed Features

The following features have been removed in the 2024.1 release of the {{% ctx %}} Innovation Platform:

#### SQL Server Dependency

* SQL Server will no longer be required by [Gateway][], the [installation and documentation has been improved][Improved Installation] to reflect this and no longer requires SQL Server.

Note: If you are adding Innovation to a 7.2 Installation, then SQL Server is still required due to the requirements of the 7.2 platform.
