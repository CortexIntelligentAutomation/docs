### Features

#### Capability

##### Process and Activity

The [concept of Process and Activity][Process and Activity] has been introduced to the {{% ctx %}} Gateway. This allows for the creation of [Process][] and [Activity][] flows.  
[Processes][] are a type of [Flow][] that can contain multiple [Activities][] and are used to model high-level business processes.  
[Activities][] are a type of [Flow][] that can be used to model tasks or actions.

<!-- 	Process Design & Execution - CORTEX Studio - Prevent copy paste between flows and processes	-->
<!-- 	Process Design & Execution - Gateway - Change icon of Process flows	-->
<!-- 	Process Design & Execution - Gateway - Rename Flow to Activity	-->
<!-- 	Process Design & Execution - Finalise blocks	-->
<!-- 	Process Design & Execution - Finalise Process Templates	-->
<!-- 	Process Design & Execution - Logging	-->

##### Saving Output Properties to multiple variables

It is now possible to use the [Expression editor][] for output properties.  
This provides a new [decomposition syntax][decomposition of output properties] allowing saving selected values from an output property to multiple variables.

<!-- 	Decomposition of Output Variables - Json Notation	-->

##### Execution context variable

A new [built-in _executionContext variable][] is now exposed in [processes and activities][process and activity].  
The `_executionContext` variable contains the initiator of the flow execution, as well as an `Extensions` property that can be used to store additional information.

<!-- 	Flow Engine - Expose Initiator on new _executionContext builtin variable	-->

##### Proxy to the {{% ctx %}} 7 Flow API

A new proxy to the {{% ctx %}} 7 Flow [API][] has been added to to simplify migrating to the platform. This allows for the execution of flows using the same [API][] as the one used in {{% ctx %}} 7.  

<!-- 	Legacy FlowAPI - Add API logging	-->
<!-- 	Legacy FlowApi - Add authorisation	-->
<!-- 	Legacy FlowAPI - Add configuration for the load balancer to send to all instances of the new service	-->

The [API][] includes the following endpoints:

* Encrypt
* Run Flow
* Run Flow Asynchronously

<!-- 	Legacy Flow API - Encryption endpoint	-->
<!-- 	Legacy FlowAPI - Add Encrypt endpoint	-->
<!-- 	Legacy FlowAPI - Add legacy-style API for running flows async	-->
<!-- 	Legacy FlowAPI - New service hosting legacy-style flowAPI - sync	-->

The [API][] also includes new management endpoints to map between a FlowName and specific package versions:

* Get all mappings
* Add single mapping
* Remove single mapping
* Remove all mappings

<!-- 	Legacy FlowAPI - Ability to configure mapping between a FlowName and specific package versions	-->

#### Observability

##### Logging added to blocks that communicate with external systems

[Block logging][] has been added to blocks that communicate with external systems.  
The following blocks and properties are logged:

* [Execute Data Command][]
  * [CommandText][] of the [Command][]
  * [Parameters][] of the [Command][]
* [Execute HTTP Request][]
  * [HTTPRequest][]
  * [HTTPResponse][]
* [Execute SOAP Request][]
  * [SOAPRequest][]
  * [SOAPResponse][]
* [Execute Powershell Script][]
  * [Script][]
  * [Parameters][]
  * [Outputs][]
  * [Records][]
* [Execute SSH Command][]
  * [Command][]
  * [Response][]
  * [SSH Logs][]

<!-- 	Logging - Enable block logging for specific blocks	-->

#### Scalability

##### Reduction of total number of NServiceBus endpoints and RabbitMQ queues

An exercise has been undertaken to reduce the total number of NServiceBus endpoints and RabbitMQ queues in the platform.
This has been achieved by consolidating the endpoints and queues where possible.

<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Periodically delete unused rabbitmq queues	-->
<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Reduce number of logical endpoints in API gateway service	-->
<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Reduce number of logical endpoints in Authorisation service	-->
<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Reduce number of logical endpoints in Concurrency Management service	-->
<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Reduce number of logical endpoints in Configuration Management service	-->
<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Reduce number of logical endpoints in Data Storage service	-->
<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Reduce number of logical endpoints in Execution Management service	-->
<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Reduce number of logical endpoints in Execution service	-->
<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Reduce number of logical endpoints in Licence Management service	-->
<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Reduce number of logical endpoints in Monitoring service	-->
<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Reduce number of logical endpoints in Package Management service	-->
<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Reduce number of logical endpoints in Provisioning service	-->
<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Reduce number of logical endpoints in Scheduling service	-->
<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Reduce number of logical endpoints in Triggers service	-->

#### Security

##### Upgrade OpenSSL

The OpenSSL version shipped with the platform has been upgraded to the latest version.
<!-- 	3rd Party Libraries - Upgrade OpenSSL	-->

##### Multi-domain certificates support

Support for Multi Domain Certificates in HA deployment is now supported.
<!-- 	Product Portal - Support for Multi Domain Certificates in HA deployment needs adding (and testing)	-->

##### New CortexManagementUser added to manage RabbitMQ queues

A new management user for RabbitMQ queues is now created when providing `RabbitMqManagementUser` and `RabbitMqManagementPassword` during installation or upgrade.
<!-- 	Total Cost of Ownership - Create CortexManagementUser during upgrade	-->

##### Server-side validation added to {{% ctx %}} Gateway API

The {{% ctx %}} Gateway [API][] now includes server-side validation to prevent [Path Traversal][] attacks when creating new flows and groups.
<!-- 	Security - Vodafone GNO Pentest - 56839 - Path Traversal	-->

##### Remove refresh token cookie on sign out

The refresh token cookie is now removed when a user signs out of {{% ctx %}} Gateway, preventing any further use of the token after the user has logged out.
<!-- 	Security - Vodafone GNO Pentest - 56840 - Bearer Token not Invalidated after Logout	-->

#### Usability

##### Rename Flows Charm to Dev and change icon

The Flows Charm has been renamed to Dev and the icon has been changed to reflect this.
<!-- 	CORTEX Gateway - Rename Flows Charm to Dev and change icon	-->

##### Rename Settings Charm to Admin and change icon

The Settings Charm has been renamed to Admin and the icon has been changed to reflect this.
<!-- 	CORTEX Gateway - Rename Settings Charm to Admin and change icon	-->

#### Third-party Support

##### Upgrade to .NET 8

The platform has been upgraded to [.NET 8][], allowing us to go to the latest version of [Service Fabric][].
This was required as .NET 6 will be out of support in November.

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
Upgrade excludes {{% ctx %}} Gateway as currently on .NET Framework 4.7.2 which is not compatible with .NET 8, and still under long term support.
{{% /alert %}}
<!-- 	Upgrade .Net - Upgrade to NET 8	-->

##### Upgrade to the latest version of Service Fabric

The latest version of Service Fabric has been included in the artefacts.  
During upgrade, the Service Fabric cluster version will be upgrade to the packaged version in the artefacts.
<!-- 	Platform Upgrade - ServiceFabric Cluster Version needs upgrading in the upgrade scripts	-->

#### Installation

##### Support installation when files are blocked by the operating system

The installation scripts have been amended to unblock files before running if the operating system has file being blocked by `Zone.Identifier`.  

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
`Zone.Identifier` is a file property that indicates a file was downloaded from the internet and is potentially unsafe. Windows uses this property as a protection feature.
{{% /alert %}}
<!-- 	Installation - Amend Installation scripts to unblock files before running	-->

`Zone.Identifier` is a file property that indicates a file was downloaded from the internet and is potentially unsafe. Windows uses this property as a protection feature.
{{% /alert %}}
<!-- 	Installation - Amend Installation scripts to unblock files before running	-->

##### Execution Service is upgraded when the engine version is unchanged

The Execution Service will now be upgraded when the engine version is unchanged. This is to ensure the upgrade works, including edge cases such as patches.
<!-- 	Platform Upgrade - Execution Service should be upgraded when the engine version is unchanged	-->

##### Handling of the Execution Services lifecycle events

The Execution Services handle Service Fabric lifecycle events allowing flows to end gracefully within a defined period.  
This includes a `Graceful Period timeout` and a `Cancel Period Timeout`, both which default to 5 minutes, and are configurable.

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
For more information on how to modify these values, please contact [{{% ctx %}} Service Portal][CORTEX Service Portal] for further assistance.
{{% /alert %}}

<!-- 	Service Fabric - Execution Services should handle Service Fabric lifecycle events so flows end gracefully within allowed period	-->
<!-- 	Service Fabric - Execution Services should read in the timeout periods for shutdown from a configuration file	-->
<!-- 	Service Fabric - Gather data from customer on sensible timeouts for service shutdown	-->

#### Documentation

##### Process and Activities

The [What is a Flow][] documentation has been updated to include information on the new concepts of [Process and Activities][].
<!-- 	Process Design & Execution - Documentation - Update What Is A Flow to talk about types of flow (Process and Activity)	--> COMMITTED

##### Decomposition of Output properties

The [What is a Block Property][] documentation has been updated to include information on the new [Decomposition of Output properties][] feature.
<!-- 	Product Portal - add Decomposition of Output properties to What is a Block Property information page	--> NEW

##### Prevent deadlocks when using semaphores

A new section has been added to the documentation explaining how to [prevent deadlocks][] when using semaphores.
<!-- 	Product Portal - What is a semaphore? - Preventing Deadlocks	-->

##### Screenshots updated

Screenshots within the documentation has been updated to reflect the new branding, including [Blocks][] icons and various [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][] screenshots.
<!-- 	Product Portal - Screenshots (including those that contain Blocks) need updatingProduct Portal - Screenshots (including those that contain Blocks) need updating	-->

##### Flow compatibility version introduced

The [Flow compatibility version][] has been added to the release notes.
<!-- 	Product Portal - Add flows compatibility in compatibility table	-->

##### General improvements to the documentation

<!-- 	Product Portal - Upgrade instructions for Observability	-->
<!-- 	Product Portal - Incorrect Formatting/Information in Installation docs	-->
<!-- 	Product Portal - Installation - Cortex Web Application - UseWindowsDefender description says true to false when it's already false	-->

### Bug Fixes

#### Capability

##### {{% ctx %}} Gateway encryptor not aligned with Service Fabric

The Encryptor has been aligned between the {{% ctx %}} Gateway and Service Fabric.  
This ensures that encrypted values created with the default key can still be decrypted if a custom private key has been set.

<!-- 	CORTEX Studio - Align Encryptor between gateway and service fabric	-->
<!-- 	Encryption - Decrypting value with a different private key causes original string to be returned	-->

#### Upgrade

##### Certificate update does not work after upgrade

A bug has been fixed which prevented the update of certificates after an upgrade.

<!-- 	Upgrade - Update certificate does not work after upgrade	-->

#### Documentation

##### Missing Platform property in Log Event documentation

The Platform property the the Log Event documentation was missing. This has been added to the documentation.
