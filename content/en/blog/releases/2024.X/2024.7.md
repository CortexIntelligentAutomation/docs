## Release Notes

### Features

#### Improved {{% ctx %}} Gateway

##### SchemaOverrides are updated on upgrade

Previously, the schemaOverrides.user.json and schemaOverrides.default.json were not updated when upgrading the {{% ctx %}} platform, now schema overrides will be updated by default. This permits new blocks to have the right default values on upgrade.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

<!-- Blocks Provider Host - Improve schema generation to allow for upgrades -->

##### Improved 'Home' page loading placeholder

The Home page loading placeholder has been improved to provide a better user experience.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

<!-- CORTEX Studio - Fix styling of loading skeletons on homepage in light and dark mode -->

##### Improved Search bar styling

Previously, the search bar did not have any icon to indicate that it was a search bar, and the delete button was always visible. This has now been rectified.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

<!-- CORTEX Studio - Search bar styling -->

#### Tenant System

##### Tenant/System is created on startup/restart

Previously, only the `default` `Tenant`/`System` was created on Service Fabric service startup/restart. Now, as the target `Tenant` and `System` is now configurable from the {{% ctx %}} Gateway's `Web.config`, it is created in the {{% ctx %}} Configuration Management Service on startup/restart of {{% ctx %}} Gateway.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

<!-- CORTEX Gateway - Tenant/System should be created on startup/restart -->
<!-- CORTEX Gateway - Tenant/System should be created on the flow debugger on start-up/restart -->

##### Errors are retried when creating tenant/system in startup

Previously, if there was an error when creating the `Tenant`/`System` on startup/restart, {{% ctx %}} Gateway would not retry the operation. Now, {{% ctx %}} Gateway will retry the operation if there is an error.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

<!-- CORTEX Gateway - Retry any errors when creating tenant/system in startup -->

#### Logging

##### Redact any value that has the format of an encrypted text

Previously, logs would contain encrypted text. Now, encrypted text will redact in logs.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Authorisation Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Concurrency Management Service][]
  <!-- * [{{% ctx %}} Configuration Management Service][] -->
  <!-- * [{{% ctx %}} Data Storage Service][] -->
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][]

  <!-- * [{{% ctx %}} Package Management Service][] -->
  <!-- * [{{% ctx %}} Provisioning Service][] -->
  <!-- * [{{% ctx %}} Scheduling Service][] -->
  * [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]

<!-- Logging - Redact any value that has the format of an encrypted text -->

##### Context User has been added to API Gateway HTTPEvent logs

Previously, the context user was not added to the API Gateway HTTPEvent logs. Now, the context user is added to the API Gateway HTTPEvent logs for both Basic and OAuth2.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]

<!-- Logging - Context User is added to API Gateway HTTPEvent logs -->
