* Scalability
* Usability
* Documentation

This release shows [Performance][] improvements in a number of areas:

* [Reduce the number of license check calls][]

Scalability has been improved by adding [support of custom names for default Tenant and System][Custom names supported for default Tenant and System] from {{% ctx %}} Gateway, as well as [support for installing multiple {{% ctx %}} Gateway instances on the same Web App Server][].  
\
The previous `Scope` data type has been renamed to [ScopeDefinition][] as it more accurately reflects its purpose of defining a scope; allowing for a new [Scope][] data type to represent an instance of a scope.  
\
The [user experience of {{% ctx %}} Gateway][{{% ctx %}} Gateway] has seen improvements which include:

### Features

#### Performance

##### Reduced the number of license check calls

Previously, the [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][] would request to the [{{% ctx %}} Licence Management Service][] whether the license was valid before every flow execution. Now, the [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][] will only query the license on startup, license added, license removed, and license updated events.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]

##### Reduce memory usage of the Package Management Service

Previously, the Package Management Service would keep the raw Flow JSON in memory, causing high RAM usage. This has now been greatly improved by compressing the Flow JSON.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Package Management Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]

#### Security

##### Redact any value in logs that has the format of an encrypted text

Previously, logs would contain encrypted text. Now, encrypted text will be redacted in logs.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]
* {{% ctx %}} Encryptor
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Authorisation Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Concurrency Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Configuration Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Data Storage Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Licence Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Package Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Provisioning Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Scheduling Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]

##### Request user has been added to API Gateway HTTPEvent logs

The name of the user making the HTTP request has been added to the API Gateway HTTPEvent logs.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]

#### Tenancy

##### Custom names supported for default Tenant and System

Previously, the platform installed with a default `Tenant`/`System` both named `default`.
Custom names can now be provided for both the `Tenant` and `System` during installation or by modifying the {{% ctx %}} Gateway's `Web.config`.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### Scope

##### Scope data type has been renamed

The previous `Scope` data type has been renamed to [ScopeDefinition][] as it more accurately reflects its purpose of defining a scope.  

A new [Scope][] data type has also been added to represent an instance of a scope.  

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
This is a breaking change and will require a flow upgrade, which is documented in the {{< ahref path="Cortex.Guides.UpgradeCortex.2024.5to2024.7.Advanced.UpgradeFlows" title="upgrade flows steps" version="2024.7" >}}.

  * [{{% ctx %}} Configuration Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Data Storage Service][]

#### {{% ctx %}} Gateway

##### Improved Home page loading placeholder

The Home page loading placeholder has been improved to provide a better user experience.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

##### Improved Search bar styling

Previously, the search bar did not have any icon to indicate that it was a search bar, and the delete button was always visible. This has now been addressed to provide a better user experience.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### Installation

##### Support for installing multiple {{% ctx %}} Gateway instances on the same Web App Server

The installation script now supports installing multiple {{% ctx %}} Gateway instances on the same Web App Server; this has been made possible by exposing the `Tenant`, `System`, `SiteName` and `GatewayApplicationName` as parameters in the installation script.  

Currently, there is no documentation available on how to do this. For further assistance, please raise a case in the [{{% ctx %}} Service Portal][].

Affected Components:

* {{% ctx %}} Web App Server Install Scripts

#### Product Portal

##### Wireless Blocks

The [Wireless Blocks][] documentation including:

* [Wireless Sender][] block
* [Wireless Receiver][] block
* [WirelessReceiverBlockReference][] data type
* [WirelessReceiverBlockNotFoundException][] exception

##### Execute Data Command Block

Extended [Execute Data Command Block][] documentation including:

* [UserCredentials][] data type
* [LogonType][] data type

##### Scope and ScopeDefinition

Update [Scope][] documentation to reflect changes:

* Update [Scope][] data type
* Add new [ScopeDefinition][] data type

##### Upgrade

Added [upgrade steps][] from 2024.5 to 2024.7 including [upgrade flows steps][].

##### Block Icons

Updated [blocks][Blocks] with their new icon designs.

### Bug Fixes

#### Performance

##### Expression editor in {{% ctx %}} Studio leaks memory

A bug has been fixed which would cause the expression editor to not be destroyed properly, causing a memory leak. This has now been fixed.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

#### Engine

##### Flow with expression sometimes fails to execute with a KeyNotFoundException

Previously, a flow with an expression could sometimes fail to execute with a KeyNotFoundException. This has now been fixed.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]

#### Logging

##### Password redaction not always occurring

Previously, password redaction would not always occur. This has now been fixed.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Authorisation Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Concurrency Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Configuration Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Data Storage Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Licence Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Package Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Provisioning Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Scheduling Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]

#### Product Portal

##### Incorrect link in Multiple Server Install Web Application Prerequisites

Previously, when performing the [Import Certificate Manually][] step and the certificates were imported automatically, the user would click on the link [Perform Cortex Gateway Installation][] which would have caused skipping the [Install Flow Debugger][] step. This has now been fixed.

### Breaking Changes

The following features have introduced breaking changes in the 2024.7 release of the {{% ctx %}} Platform:

#### Scope data type has been renamed

The following feature has changed any block property that used the previous `Scope` data type:

* [Scope data type has been renamed][]

All flows that use the previous `Scope` data type will need to be [upgraded][upgrade flows steps].

Any flow not upgraded using this tool will need to be edited, saved, and committed in {{% ctx %}} Gateway otherwise they cannot be published in a new package or new version of a package. Using the {{% ctx %}} Flows Upgrader on all flows is recommended to reduce any manual input required to get flows into a publishable state.

#### Flows are now compressed in the Package Management Service

The following feature has changed the way flows are stored in the Package Management Service:

* [Reduce memory usage of the Package Management Service][]

All flows are now compressed when stored in the Package Management Service. This is a breaking change because it has required a change to the Execution Service to decompress the flows before execution.

### Known Limitations

There are no known limitations added as part of the 2024.7 release of the {{% ctx %}} Platform.
