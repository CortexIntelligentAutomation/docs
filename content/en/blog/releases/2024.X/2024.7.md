### Features

#### Performance

##### Reduced the number license check calls

Previously, the [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][] would request to the [{{% ctx %}} Licence Management Service][] whether the license was valid before every flow execution. Now, the [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][] will only query the license on startup, license added, license removed, and license updated events.

<!-- Platform Performance - Execution Service - Too many calls to check if the server is licensed -->

##### Reduce memory usage of the Package Management Service

Previously, the Package Management Service would keep the raw Flow JSON in memory, causing high RAM usage. This has now been greatly improved by compressing the Flow JSON.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Package Management Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]

<!-- Platform Performance - Package Management Service - Runs with high RAM - Main branch -->
<!-- Platform Performance - Package Management Service - Runs with high RAM - Patch for V2024.1 -->
<!-- Platform Performance - Package Management Service - Runs with high RAM - Patch for V2024.5 -->

#### Security

##### Redact any value in logs that has the format of an encrypted text

Previously, logs would contain encrypted text. Now, encrypted text will be redacted in logs.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Authorisation Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Concurrency Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Configuration Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Data Storage Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Licence Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Package Management Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Provisioning Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Scheduling Service][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Triggers Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]

<!-- Logging - Redact any value that has the format of an encrypted text -->

##### Request user has been added to API Gateway HTTPEvent logs

The name of the user making the HTTP request has been added to the API Gateway HTTPEvent logs.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Core Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} API Gateway Service][]

<!-- Logging - Context User is added to API Gateway HTTPEvent logs -->

#### Tenancy

##### Custom names supported for default Tenant and System

Previously, the platform installed with a default `Tenant`/`System` both named `default`.
Custom names can now be provided for both the `Tenant` and `System` during installation or by modifying the {{% ctx %}} Gateway's `Web.config`.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

<!-- CORTEX Gateway - Tenant/System should be created on startup/restart -->
<!-- CORTEX Gateway - Tenant/System should be created on the flow debugger on start-up/restart -->
<!-- CORTEX Gateway - Retry any errors when creating tenant/system in startup -->

#### Scope

##### Scope data type has been renamed

The previous `Scope` data type has been renamed to [ScopeDefinition][] as it more accurately reflects its purpose of defining a scope.  

A new [Scope][] data type has also been added to represent an instance of a scope.  

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
This is a breaking change and will require a flow migration, which is documented in the [upgrade flows steps][].

#### {{% ctx %}} Gateway

##### Improved Home page loading placeholder

The Home page loading placeholder has been improved to provide a better user experience.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

<!-- CORTEX Studio - Fix styling of loading skeletons on homepage in light and dark mode -->

##### Improved Search bar styling

Previously, the search bar did not have any icon to indicate that it was a search bar, and the delete button was always visible. This has now been addressed to provide a better user experience.

Affected Components:

* [{{% ctx %}} Gateway][Gateway]

<!-- CORTEX Studio - Search bar styling -->

#### Installation

##### Support for installing multiple {{% ctx %}} Gateway instances on the same Web App Server

The installation script now supports installing multiple {{% ctx %}} Gateway instances on the same Web App Server; this has been made possible by exposing the Tenant, System, SiteName and GatewayApplicationName as parameters in the installation script.  

Currently, there is no documentation available on how to do this. For further assistance, please raise a case in the [{{% ctx %}} Service Portal][].

<!-- DELETE? Did not expend further as might be deleted. -->
<!-- CORTEX Flow Upgrader - EndWorkSpace Block throws null exception -->

#### Logging

#### Product Portal

##### Fix link in Multiple Server Install Web Application Prerequisites

Previously, when performing the [Import Certificate Manually step][] and the certificates were imported automatically, the user would click on the link [Perform Cortex Gateway Installation][] which would have caused skipping the [Install Flow Debugger][] step. This has now been fixed.

<!-- Product Portal - Multiple server - Install flow debugger skipped -->

#### Engine

* [{{% ctx %}} Innovation Execution Application][]
  * [{{% ctx %}} Execution Service][]
* [{{% ctx %}} Block Packages][Blocks]
