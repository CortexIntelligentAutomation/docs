1. Log on to one of the Application Servers.
1. Import the client certificate used for the original installation of the application. Its location is specified in the `ClientCertificatePath` parameter of the `Cortex.Innovation.Install.ps1` file of the original installation.

    If the .PFX file is available on the server:
    * Double-click on the client certificate .PFX file and follow the wizard.

    If the .PFX file is not available:
    * Identify the certificate to export by opening the `Cortex.Upgrade.ApplicationConfig.json` configuration file located in `C:\ProgramData\Cortex\Upgrade` and locate the value of the `applicationServerCertificateSubject` and `applicationServerCertificateThumbprint`.
    * Find the certificate by using the `Manage Computer Certificates` tool in Windows.  In the `Personal` store, the certificate will have an `Issued To` similar to `applicationServerCertificateSubject` and to confirm it is the right certificate double-click the certificate, select the `Details` tab and locate the `Thumbprint` property to compare the value to that in `applicationServerCertificateThumbprint`.
    * Export the certificate as a pfx file and then import it to the `Current User` store by double-clicking on it and following the wizard.
1. Open a web browser.
1. Navigate to `https://app-server.domain.com:9080/Explorer`, where `app-server.domain.com` is the fully qualified domain name of any Application Server. Replace `9080` with new `httpGatewayEndpointPort` value if it was changed during configuration of the original installation.

    The screen should resemble that in the following figure:
    {{< figure src="/images/Service Fabric Explorer.png" >}}

    The status circles should be entirely green - this indicates that all nodes, services and instances are healthy. Other status pages can be accessed by expanding items in the leftmost pane. Issues can be tracked down to the failing component by expanding items with warning triangles or error icons on. The next few diagrams show the status pages for a healthy system.

    After expanding the application, clicking on any of the services should display a green circle and `Status = Active`:

    {{< figure src="/images/Service Fabric Explorer - Service.png" >}}

    After expanding either of the services, clicking on any of the instances/partitions should display a green circle and `Status = Ready`:

    {{< figure src="/images/Service Fabric Explorer - Instance.png" >}}

    Clicking on any of the nodes at the bottom of the leftmost pane should display a green circle and `Status = Up`:

    {{< figure src="/images/Service Fabric Explorer - Node.png" >}}

    If any warning triangles appear, wait for 5 minutes or so as the cluster may still be starting up. If the cluster looks OK, go to the next section.

    If the warnings persist or anything on the screen goes red, expand the items to find the individual services and instances which have errors or warnings. Warnings should not be ignored as they can indicate that the service canâ€™t start but is still in the retry phase. Error and warning messages should be displayed on the status screens and should indicate what is wrong.

    If no useful message can be seen here, the service log files may contain more information. These can be found on each Application Server at:

    * `%ProgramData%/Cortex/API Gateway Service/Logs`
    * `%ProgramData%/Cortex/Execution Service/Logs`
