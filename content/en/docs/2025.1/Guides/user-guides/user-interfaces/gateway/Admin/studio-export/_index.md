## Anatomy

{{< figure src="/images/Studio Export.png" title="Studio Export" >}}

Any flow in the system may be exported; it is not necessary for the administrator to have View or Edit authorisation for the flows to be exported.

Individual flows are selected by clicking the checkbox in the `Export?` column adjacent to the flow to be exported. If a group is selected, then all the flows contained in that group, and any sub-groups, will be implicitly set; any implicitly set may be individually deselected by clicking the checkbox adjacent to the flow.

Clicking `Export` will create the Studio Package from the Master Versions in the Master Repository of the selected flows, including their group hierarchy, and then download the package to the hostâ€™s browser as a file named `export.studiopkg` or `export <n>.studiopkg`, where `<n>` represents an integer to avoid naming conflict with other Studio Package files contained in the same folder.

## Remarks

### Known Limitations

* Any flows that are dependencies of selected flows will not be automatically selected for export.
