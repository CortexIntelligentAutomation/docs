## Summary

The `DayOfWeek` data type is used to represent a day of the week from Sunday (i.e. `DayOfWeek.Sunday`) through Saturday (i.e. `DayOfWeek.Saturday`).

`DayOfWeek` is an [enum][Working with Enums] data type, which means it has a defined set of values, where each value has an associated [String][] name and [Int32][] value.
