# {{< param title >}}

This guide describes how to upgrade Gateway on v7.2 to include Innovation. Please ensure that [Install Application Server][] has been completed before starting this installation. These steps assume that the v7.2 version of Gateway and its prerequisites have already been installed.

The steps to add Innovation functionality to 7.2 are:

1. Install Flow Debugger Service
1. Upgrade Gateway

## Make Installation Artefacts Available

1. Copy the following artefacts to a folder on the machine:

   * Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Block Packages.zip
   * Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Gateway.zip
   * Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Flow Debugger Service.zip
   * Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Web App Server Install Scripts.zip

2. Extract the `Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Web App Server Install Scripts.zip` zip file to a folder with the same name.

## Install Prerequisites

### Licensing

Ensure that a valid Cortex licence file named `Cortex.lic` exists on the server, in the location `%ProgramData%\Cortex\Licences`. If it does not, follow the instructions located at [Licensing Requirements][].

### Get Flow Debugger Application Pool User

A domain user account is required for the Flow Debugger Service web application pool and must be created prior to performing the installation. In line with best practices, this account should not be used for any purposes other than those specified for the Flow Debugger Service. Alternatively, the `NETWORK SERVICE` user may also be used.

This user must currently have access to the default NuGet directory, in order to load block packages correctly. To add permissions for the user take the following steps:

1. Navigate to `%SystemRoot%\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\` and create a new folder named `NuGet` if one does not exist.
1. Right-click on the `NuGet` folder and click `Properties`.
1. In the dialog, click the `Security` tab.
1. Click the `Edit...` button.
1. Click the `Add...` button.
1. Enter the username of the application pool user and click `OK`.
1. In the `Permissions` section at the bottom, check `Full control`
1. Click `OK`.

The user must be given `Log on as a service` and `Log on as a batch job` permissions. To do this take the following steps:

1. Navigate to `Start` -> `Administrative Tools` -> `Local Security Policy`.
1. In the Local Security Policy dialog, expand the `Local Policies` node then select `User Rights Assignment`.
1. Take the following steps for the `Log on as a service` and `Log on as a batch job` policies:

    1. In the right-hand panel, double-click on the policy.
    1. In the Properties dialog, click on the `Add User or Group` button.
        {{% alert title="Note" %}}It is possible to use the `Advancedâ€¦` button to look up names rather than entering them manually. Various filters can be set to find the correct user or group more easily. Multiple users can be selected by holding down `CTRL` while clicking. `OK` adds the selected users or groups into the `Enter the object names to select` text box.{{% /alert %}}
    1. Type the name of the application pool user account into the `Enter the object names to select` text box. Click the `Check Names` button to confirm that the user exists.
    1. Click `OK` on the Select Users dialog, and then confirm the user is correct by clicking `OK` on the Properties dialog.

### Certificate Requirements

In order to ensure that the correct certificate is used during the upgrade of Cortex Gateway, it is necessary to [assign a friendly name][Assign Certificate Friendly Name] to the certificate that is currently being used. It is important to set the `ImportCertificate` parameter to `$false` when [configuring the Cortex Gateway installation script][Configure Cortex Gateway Installation Script].

#### Assign Certificate Friendly Name

A Friendly Name should be assigned to the certificater being used for the Cortex Website. This will be used in the [Configure Cortex Gateway Installation Script][] to assign the correct certificate to the site:

1. Click the Windows button (`Start`).
1. Type `certlm.msc` and press `Enter` to open the Certificate Manager dialog.
1. Expand `Personal` and select `Certificates`.
1. You should see your certificate in this store.
1. Right-click on the certificate and select `Properties`.
1. On the `General` tab in the `Friendly Name` text box, enter a name to be used for the certificate.
1. Click `OK`.

## Perform Installation

### Configure Flow Debugger Installation Script

1. In the `Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Web App Server Install Scripts` folder, locate the `Cortex.Innovation.Install.FlowDebuggerService.ps1` script and open it with a text editor.

1. Choose the tab below that matches the configuration for this installation, then update the script to match, changing the parameters according to the details given below:

    {{< tabpane lang="powershell" >}}
        {{< tab header="CA Certs">}}

1. Save and close `Cortex.Innovation.Install.Gateway.ps1`.

### Run Installation Script

1. Open a Windows PowerShell (x64) window as administrator.
1. Navigate PowerShell to inside the `Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Web App Server Install Scripts` folder using the following command, modifying the path as necessary:

    ```powershell
    cd "C:\Install\Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Web App Server Install Scripts"
    ```

1. Type the following command into PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    .\Cortex.Innovation.Install.Gateway.ps1
    ```

1. Please read the End User Licence Agreement which can be found [here][Eula]. Once you agree to the terms, add the flag `-AcceptEULA` to the command entered above, e.g:

    ```powershell
    .\<CortexInnovationInstallScriptName>.ps1 -AcceptEULA
    ```

1. Run the PowerShell command to install the Flow Debugger and Cortex Gateway.
1. If `ImportCertificate` is set to $true, and the file is of type `.pfx`, a prompt will appear for the certificate password. This should be entered, and then hit `Enter`.
1. A credentials prompt will appear. Enter the credentials of the user that should run the `Debugger` application pool in IIS. If using the `NETWORK SERVICE` user, enter any user as the username and leave the password blank; the `NETWORK SERVICE` user will need to be selected in the final step.
1. A prompt will appear to enter the password for the user specified to run the Cortex Gateway Application Pool.  This should be entered, and then hit `Enter`.
1. An error may have appeared during the Flow Debugger Installation saying:

    ```
    The Windows Process Activation Service service is not started.
    ```

    This can be ignored.
1. Check that there have been no other errors in the script; these would appear in red in the console.

    If there are any errors, then please follow any instructions given within them to rectify the situation, and retry the installation.

    If the errors do not give any instructions on how to rectify, please contact [Cortex Service Portal][] for further assistance.

1. Once the PowerShell script execution has completed, a prompt will appear to restart the machine.  You can choose to restart now (`N`) or later (`L`).
1. If using `NETWORK SERVICE` for the Flow Debugger application pool user:

    1. Open Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.
    1. On the left, expand the server node.
    1. Click `Application Pools`.
    1. Right-click on the `Debugger` application pool and select `Advanced Settings...`.
    1. In the `Advanced Settings` dialog, click on `Identity` and then click the ellipses (`...`).
    1. In the `Application Pool Identity` dialog, select `Built-in account`, then select `NetworkService` from the drop-down, then click `OK`.
    1. Right-click on the `Debugger` application pool and click `Recycle...`.

1. The Cortex Gateway website will now be available on `<protocol>://<host>:<port>/<webapplicationname>`, e.g. `https://localhost/gateway`.

## Preserve installation files

Ensure that the installation files are backed up or kept on the server, especially the scripts and config files that have been modified. This will make it easier to perform further actions in future, such as troubleshooting, certificate rollover, uninstallation, reinstallation and updates.
