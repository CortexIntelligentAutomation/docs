## Description

This dashboard provides the information required to analyse the health of the Cortex Innovation platform. It will display data based on the [Time Range][] that has been specified.

At the top of the page there is a dashboard description. This provides information about what the dashboard is reporting and what each of the filters are. The description is always collapsed by default.

The dashboard is then split into 5 main sections:

- [Overview](#overview-section)
- [Availability](#availability-section)
- [Requests](#requests-section)
- [Errors](#errors-section)
- [Duration](#duration-section)

There are several [filters](#filters) available to filter the data to a more fine-grained level as necessary and are explained in further detail below.

## Time Range

{{% alert type="note" title="Note" %}}Choosing large time ranges will increase the time it takes for the data to be loaded into the dashboard.{{% /alert %}}

The time range for which the dashboard displays data is configurable in the top right of the dashboard using the Time Range selector (defaults to the last 3 hours):

{{< figure src="/images/editable/Platform Health - Time Range.png">}}

There are a number of predefined quick ranges to choose from:

- Last 5, 15 and 30 minutes
- Last 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours
- Last 2, 7, 30 and 90 days
- Last 6 months
- Last 1, 2 and 5 years
- Yesterday
- Day before yesterday
- This day last week
- Previous week, month, fiscal quarter, year, fiscal year
- Today
- Today so far
- This month, fiscal quarter, year and fiscal year
- This month, fiscal quarter, year and fiscal year so far

To configure an absolute time range, you should specify a From and To date and time.  These values can be in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, e.g. `2022-07-22 13:54:23`, or alternatively can use times relative to now, e.g. `now-24h`. It is also possible to use the date time picker available for both the From and To fields. Once the absolute time range has been configured you must click the 'Apply time range' button.

If an absolute time range is specified, the Time Range selector will show the selected time range with arrows either side. These arrows can be used to shift the time range forwards and backwards. This feature is not available for quick ranges.

{{< figure src="/images/editable/Platform Health - Time Range extended.png">}}

The magnifying glass icon allows you to zoom out of the time range specified. It will substract half the current time range from the From field and add half the current time range to the To field.

For more information regarding the Time Range selector, see Grafana's [Time range controls][] documentation.

## Filters

At the top of the dashboard, there are 9 filters available to restrict the data queried:

{{< figure src="/images/editable/Platform Health - Filters.png">}}

|Filter  |Description|
|--------|-----------|
| Tenant | List of tenants. Defaulted to All. |
| System | List of systems. Defaulted to All. |
| Node | List of hosts that processed the requests. Defaulted to All. |
| API | List of the API endpoints found in the HTTP requests. Defaulted to All. |
| Status Code | List of [status codes][] found in the HTTP responses. Defaulted to All. |
| Result | List of results found in the HTTP responses. Defaulted to All. |
| Initiator IP Address | List of IP addresses for the initiators of the requests. Defaulted to All. |
| Interval | List of intervals to perform the time series aggregations upon. This only affects the graphs on this dashboard.<br> <br>The available values for this filter are auto, 1m, 10m, 30m, 1h, 6h, 12h, 1d, 7d, 14d, 30d.<br> <br>If *auto* is selected, as is the default, Grafana will aggregate to a level it deems appropriate for the time range specified. |
| Custom Filter | Enables filtering on all available values, including those not exposed by default. |

All filters (excluding Interval and Custom Filter) will display their list of available options dependent on the preceding filters selected.

## Overview Section

This section displays key platform health metrics for the specified [time range][] and consists of 4 panels.

{{< figure src="/images/editable/Platform Health - Overview.png">}}

{{% alert type="note" title="Note" %}}The Interval filter does not affect these panels.{{% /alert %}}

### Availability

This tile displays the availability of the platform by calculating the successful requests / total requests during the specified [time range][]. Successful requests are all requests that do not result in a 5xx HTTP response, 4xx responses are considered successful in this scenario. This tile has thresholds set to colour code the tile depending on the value. These thresholds can be [customised][customise threholds], however the default thresholds are:

| Threshold | Value | Colour |
|------------------|-----------|------------|
| OK  | &gt;= 95% | <span class="threshold-ok">green</span> |
| WARNING | &gt;= 90% | <span class="threshold-warning">orange</span> |
| CRITICAL | &lt; 90% | <span class="threshold-critical">red</span> |

### Total Requests

This tile displays the total number of requests during the specified [time range][].

### Errored Requests

This tile displays the total number of errored requests during the specified [time range][]. Errored requests are all requests that result in an unknown or 5xx HTTP response, 4xx responses are considered successful in this scenario. This tile has thresholds set to colour code the tile depending on the value.  These thresholds can be [customised][customise threholds], however the default thresholds are:

| Threshold | Value | Colour |
|------------------|-----------|------------|
| OK  | 0 | <span class="threshold-ok">green</span> |
| CRITICAL | &gt;= 1 | <span class="threshold-critical">red</span> |

### Mean Request Duration

This tile displays the mean duration for requests during the specified [time range][].

{{% alert type="note" title="Note" %}}Certain APIs may take significantly longer than others skewing the result.{{% /alert %}}

## Availability Section

This section displays the availability of the Cortex Innovation platform and consists of 1 panel.

{{< figure src="/images/editable/Platform Health - Availability.png">}}

### Availability

This graph displays the availability of the Cortex Innovation Platform during the specified [time range][] by calculating successful requests / total requests. Successful requests are all requests that do not result in an unknown or 5xx HTTP response. 4xx responses are considered successful in this scenario.

Each data point value is calculated by aggregating requests based on the Interval filter. If there is no data for the previous interval, the line will be [broken](#breaks-in-graph-lines) as the availability is not known at the time.

This graph has thresholds set to colour code the background to show when availability drops into warning and critical levels. These thresholds can be [customised][customise threholds], however the default thresholds are:

| Threshold | Value | Colour |
|------------------|-----------|------------|
| OK  | &gt;= 95% | <span class="threshold-ok">green</span> |
| WARNING | &gt;= 90% | <span class="threshold-warning">orange</span> |
| CRITICAL | &lt; 90% | <span class="threshold-critical">red</span> |

This graph is configured to start the availability axis at 80%. However, if the availability drops below this level, the axis will modify to show the lowest availability level.

## Requests Section

This section provides information regarding the history of the requests processed by the Cortex Innovation platform for the specified [time range][] and consists of 2 panels.

{{< figure src="/images/editable/Platform Health - Requests.png">}}

### Requests

This graph displays, for the specified [time range][], the:

- count of all requests. Each data point value is calculated by aggregating requests based on the Interval filter.
- count of all requests per second.

### Top 10 Responses by Total Count

This table displays the Top 10 HTTP responses that occurred during the specified [time range][] with their mean, minimum and maximum duration in seconds.

{{% alert type="note" title="Note" %}}The Interval filter does not affect this table.{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert type="note" title="Note" %}}The Interval filter does not affect this table.{{% /alert %}}

## Remarks

### Unknown values

The dashboard may display HTTP requests that have an `Unknown` status code or result, if they are missing from the raw logs. The chances of this occurring are minimal.

### Breaks in Graph Lines

When appropriate, there may occur breaks in the line graphs. This is relevant to the Availability graph.  When there is no data, it is not appropriate to say that the availability is the same as the previous data point or that it is zero as if there is no data, we cannot accurately reflect the data at this point, and therefore, the line will break.

{{< figure src="/images/editable/Platform Health - Break in Line.png">}}

### Known Limitations

#### Graphs do not reset to zero

There is a limitation in Grafana where the graph does not always return to the zero line when there is no data for a given time point. This only occurs when there is a data point available at the beginning of the graph, followed by a period with no data, then data occurs again.  When hovering the mouse over this area, it will show that the value is 0, and any other tiles will reflect the zero data at this point accordingly.
