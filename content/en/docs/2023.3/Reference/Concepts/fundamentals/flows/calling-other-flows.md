## Summary

A [flow][] may trigger the execution of another [flow][].

## Calling Another Flow

A [flow][] can be called from another [flow][] in the following ways:

- Using the [Run Flow][] block to trigger the execution of another flow directly
- Using the [Execute HTTP Request][] block to trigger a flow through the API Gateway service (this should only be used to call [flows][flow] published in a separate Cortex Innovation platform)

### Input Variables

Sometimes [flows][flow] require data to be passed to them through the use of input variables (e.g. a flow used to log errors may require a file path for where the logs are saved).

Input variables can be passed into flows in the following ways:

- For the [Run Flow][] block, input variables are configured using the Inputs property; for more information see [Run Flow Example][]
- For the [Execute HTTP Request][] block, input variables are configured within the body of the HttpRequest; for more information see example of [Calling Another Flow][]

### Output Variables

Sometimes [flows][flow] may return data through the use of output variables (e.g. a flow used to interact with a database may return its results).

Output variables are returned to the calling flow in the following ways:

- For the [Run Flow][] block, output variables are saved to the Outputs property; for more information see [Run Flow Example][]
- For the [Execute HTTP Request][] block, output variables are returned within the ResponseBody of the HttpResponse property; for more information see example of [Calling Another Flow][]

## Remarks

### Known Limitations

#### Flows can only be Called Synchronously

Currently it is only possible to call other [flows][flow] synchronously; this means the calling flow will wait for the called flow to complete its [execution][] before continuing.

In the future it will be possible to call flows asynchronously; this means the calling flow will continue after the called flow starts its [execution][] without waiting for the called flow to complete.
