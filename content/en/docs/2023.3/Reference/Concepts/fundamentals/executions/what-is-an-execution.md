## Summary

An execution represents a running instance of a [flow][], the execution moves through the flow sequentially executing each [block][] saving any outputs to [variables][variable]. A flow can have one or more executions running at any time, each with their own variables.

- See [Executions in Development][] for more information regarding working with executions in [Cortex Studio][].
- See [Executions in Production][] for more information regarding running executions in the [Cortex Execution Service][].

## Anatomy of an Execution

| Property          | Notes                                                      | Example                                                   |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Status Icon       | The Icon representing the current Status of the execution  | A list of [statuses][Execution Status] can be found below |
| Started At        | The date and time that the execution was started           | `6 Sep 2022 09:27:45`                                     |
| Updated At        | The date and time of the last update for the execution     | `6 Sep 2022 09:27:46`                                     |
| Status            | The status of the execution                                | A list of [statuses][Execution Status] can be found below |
| Block Type        | The block the execution is currently on                    | `Set Variable`                                            |
| Block Description | The description of the block the execution is currently on | `Set Variable`                                            |
| Workspace Name    | The name of the workspace the execution is currently in    | `Setup and Run Child-Flow`                                |
| Flow Name         | The name of the flow the execution is currently running    | `Parent-Flow`                                             |

When a [flow][] starts the execution of a child flow using the [Run Flow][] block, any child executions will be shown within a tree in the [Executions Grid][], for example:

### Execution Status

| Status    | Description                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Running   | The execution is currently executing                                                                                                           |
| Pausing   | The execution is in the process of pausing - e.g. a long running block may have to finish before the execution is paused                       |
| Paused    | The execution is paused on top of a block - before the block starts to execute                                                                 |
|           | The execution is paused at a breakpoint on top of a block - before the block starts to execute                                                 |
|           | The execution is paused on the output port of a block - after the block has executed but before the execution has selected which block is next |
| Exception | The execution is paused on the exception output port - after the block has thrown an exception when `break on exception` is turned on          |
| Stopping  | The execution is in the process of stopping - e.g. a long running block may have to finish before the execution is stopped                     |
| Stopped   | The execution has ended after having been manually stopped                                                                                     |
| Ended     | The execution has ended normally                                                                                                               |
| Error     | The execution has ended after having thrown an exception that was not handled                                                                  |
