# {{< param title >}}

This guide describes how to upgrade Gateway on v7.2 to include Innovation. Please ensure that [Install Application Servers and Load Balancer][] has been completed before starting this installation. These steps assume that the v7.2 version of Gateway and its prerequisites have already been installed.

The steps to add Innovation functionality to 7.2 are:

1. Upgrade {{< ctx >}} Gateway
1. Install Flow Debugger Service

## Make Installation Artefacts Available

1. We recommend that the Flow Debugger Service and {{< ctx >}} Gateway are installed on the same Web Application Server. Copy the following artefacts to a folder on the machine:

   * Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Block Packages.zip
   * Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Gateway.zip
   * Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Flow Debugger Service.zip
   * Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Web App Server Install Scripts.zip

2. Extract the `Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Web App Server Install Scripts.zip` zip file to a folder with the same name.

## Install Prerequisites

### Licensing

Ensure that a valid {{< ctx >}} licence file named `Cortex.lic` exists on the Web Application server, in the location `%ProgramData%\Cortex\Licences`. If it does not, follow the instructions located at [Licensing Requirements][].

### Get Flow Debugger Application Pool User

A domain user account is required for the Flow Debugger Service web application pool and must be created prior to performing the installation. In line with best practices, this account should not be used for any purposes other than those specified for the Flow Debugger Service. Alternatively, the `NETWORK SERVICE` user may also be used.

This user must currently have access to the default NuGet directory, in order to load block packages correctly. To add permissions for the user take the following steps:

1. Navigate to `%SystemRoot%\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\` and create a new folder named `NuGet` if one does not exist.
1. Right-click on the `NuGet` folder and click `Properties`.
1. In the dialog, click the `Security` tab.
1. Click the `Edit...` button.
1. Click the `Add...` button.
1. Enter the username of the application pool user and click `OK`.
1. In the `Permissions` section at the bottom, check `Full control`
1. Click `OK`.

The user must be given `Log on as a service` and `Log on as a batch job` permissions. To do this take the following steps:

1. Navigate to `Start` -> `Administrative Tools` -> `Local Security Policy`.
1. In the Local Security Policy dialog, expand the `Local Policies` node then select `User Rights Assignment`.
1. Take the following steps for the `Log on as a service` and `Log on as a batch job` policies:

    1. In the right-hand panel, double-click on the policy.
    1. In the Properties dialog, click on the `Add User or Group` button.
        {{% alert title="Note" %}}It is possible to use the `Advancedâ€¦` button to look up names rather than entering them manually. Various filters can be set to find the correct user or group more easily. Multiple users can be selected by holding down `CTRL` while clicking. `OK` adds the selected users or groups into the `Enter the object names to select` text box.{{% /alert %}}
    1. Type the name of the application pool user account into the `Enter the object names to select` text box. Click the `Check Names` button to confirm that the user exists.
    1. Click `OK` on the Select Users dialog, and then confirm the user is correct by clicking `OK` on the Properties dialog.

### Certificate Requirements

In order to ensure that the correct certificate is used during the upgrade of {{< ctx >}} Gateway, it is necessary to [assign a friendly name][Assign Certificate Friendly Name] to the certificate that is currently being used for {{< ctx >}} Gateway. It is important to set the `ImportCertificate` parameter to `$false` when [configuring the {{< ctx >}} Gateway installation script][Configure CORTEX Gateway Installation Script].

#### Assign Certificate Friendly Name

A Friendly Name should be assigned to the certificate being used for the Cortex Website. This will be used in the [Configure {{< ctx >}} Gateway Installation Script][] to assign the correct certificate to the site:

1. Click the Windows button (`Start`).
1. Type `certlm.msc` and press `Enter` to open the Certificate Manager dialog.
1. Expand `Personal` and select `Certificates`.
1. You should see your certificate in this store.
1. Right-click on the certificate and select `Properties`.
1. On the `General` tab in the `Friendly Name` text box, enter a name to be used for the certificate.
1. Click `OK`.
