## Single Server Architecture

Cortex Innovation and v7.2 can run side-by-side, allowing flows to be built and run for both of them from the same Gateway instance. They each require a different set of back-end components to be installed. Innovation can be added to a Cortex v7.2 installation by using the existing hardware. The only components shared by both Innovation and v7.2 are Gateway and its databases.

The minimum architecture for adding Innovation to a v7.2 Single Site, Single Server system is as follows:

{{% alert type="warning" title="Warning" %}} This architecture is not recommended for production platforms that are required to scale and support HA. Additionally, upgrades require application redeployment with downtime rather than using rolling upgrades. {{%/alert %}}
