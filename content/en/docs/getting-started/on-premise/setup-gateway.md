### Cortex Gateway Initial Setup

Log on to Cortex Gateway and run through the setup wizard

1. Navigate to `<protocol>://<host>:<port>/<webapplicationname>`, e.g. `https://localhost/gateway`.
2. Log on using the default credentials that the solution deploys with:
    Username: `administrator`
    Password: `Adm1n1strat0r`
3. On a newly installed system, you will be presented with a Setup Wizard at this point, see Figure 146, which will guide you through some basic configuration steps:
    * Account details
    * LDAP Connection
    * LDAP Authorization
4. Follow the steps in the setup wizard to configure the relevant areas â€“ for more detail refer to "Section 2.1 Initial Configuration" in the Cortex Integrity - Studio Admin Guide which can be found on the Cortex Application server in the C:\Cortex\Help\PDF - TODO: Sort this out
    1. Click `Next Step`:

## Configure the Cortex Databases to use Transparent Data Encryption

Once Cortex Gateway has been configured, if you wish to encrypt the databases using TDE for improved security, this should now be performed. TODO: Link
