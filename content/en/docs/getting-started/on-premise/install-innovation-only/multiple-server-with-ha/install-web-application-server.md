This guide describes how to install the Web Application Server. Please ensure that [Install Application Servers and Load Balancer][] has been completed before starting this installation.

## Make Installation Artefacts Available

1. We recommend that the Flow Debugger Service and Gateway are installed on the same Web Application Server. Copy the following artefacts to a folder on the machine:
   * Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Block Packages.zip
   * Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Gateway.zip
   * Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Flow Debugger Service.zip
   * Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Web App Server Install Scripts.zip

2. Extract the `Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Web App Server Install Scripts.zip` zip file to a folder with the same name.

## Install Prerequisites

### Licensing

Ensure that a valid Cortex licence file named `Cortex.lic` exists on the Web Application server, in the location `%ProgramData%\Cortex\Licences`. If it does not, follow the instructions located at [Licensing Requirements][].

### Install SQL Server or SQL Express

1. Use one of the following installation guides to install SQL Server or SQL Server Express:
    * <a href="/pdfs/Cortex Innovation - SQL Server 2019 Installation Guide.pdf">Cortex Innovation - SQL Server 2019 Installation Guide</a>
    * <a href="/pdfs/Cortex Innovation - SQL Server 2016 Installation Guide.pdf">Cortex Innovation - SQL Server 2016 Installation Guide</a>
    * <a href="/pdfs/Cortex Innovation - SQL Server 2016 Express Installation Guide.pdf">Cortex Innovation - SQL Server 2016 Express Installation Guide</a>

### Certificate Configuration

## Install Flow Debugger Service

### Get Application Pool User

A domain user account is required for the Flow Debugger Service web application pool and must be created prior to performing the installation. In line with best practices, this account should not be used for any purposes other than those specified for the Flow Debugger Service. Alternatively, the `NETWORK SERVICE` user may also be used.

This user must currently have access to the default NuGet directory, in order to load block packages correctly. To add permissions for the user take the following steps:

1. Navigate to `%SystemRoot%\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Roaming\` and create a new folder named `NuGet` if one does not exist.
1. Right-click on the `NuGet` folder and click `Properties`.
1. In the dialog, click the `Security` tab.
1. Click the `Edit...` button.
1. Click the `Add...` button.
1. Enter the username of the application pool user and click `OK`.
1. In the `Permissions` section at the bottom, check `Full control`
1. Click `OK`.

The user must be given `Log on as a service` and `Log on as a batch job` permissions. To do this take the following steps:

1. Navigate to `Start` -> `Administrative Tools` -> `Local Security Policy`.
1. In the Local Security Policy dialog, expand the `Local Policies` node then select `User Rights Assignment`.
1. Take the following steps for the `Log on as a service` and `Log on as a batch job` policies:
    1. In the right-hand panel, double-click on the policy.
    1. In the Properties dialog, click on the `Add User or Group` button.
        {{% alert title="Note" %}}It is possible to use the `Advancedâ€¦` button to look up names rather than entering them manually. Various filters can be set to find the correct user or group more easily. Multiple users can be selected by holding down `CTRL` while clicking. `OK` adds the selected users or groups into the `Enter the object names to select` text box.{{% /alert %}}
    1. Type the name of the application pool user account into the `Enter the object names to select` text box. Click the `Check Names` button to confirm that the user exists.
    1. Click `OK` on the Select Users dialog, and then confirm the user is correct by clicking `OK` on the Properties dialog.

### Configure Installation Script

1. In the `Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Web App Server Install Scripts` folder, locate the `Cortex.Innovation.Install.FlowDebuggerService.ps1` script and open it with a text editor.

1. Choose the tab below that matches the configuration for this installation, then update the script to match, changing the parameters according to the details given below:

    {{< tabpane lang="powershell" >}}
        {{< tab header="CA Certs">}}
.\Cortex.Install.FlowDebuggerService.ps1 `
    -FlowDebuggerServicePath "C:\Install\Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Flow Debugger Service.zip" `
    -BlockPackagesPath "C:\Install\Cortex Innovation {{< version >}} - Block Packages.zip" `
    -FlowDebuggerBasicAuthUsername "BasicAuthUser" `
    -FlowDebuggerBasicAuthPassword "ADA9883B11BD4CDC908B8131B57944A4" `
    -Credential $AppPoolIdentity `

### Run Installation Script

1. Ensure the Gateway application pool is stopped:
    1. Open Internet Information Service (IIS) Manager.
    1. In the left pane, expand the server node.
    1. Click `Application Pools` to display a list of the Application Pools.
    1. Right-click the `Cortex Gateway` application pool and select `Stop`.

    {{% alert title="Note" %}}Failure to stop the application pool will result in a permissions error when installing Gateway.{{% /alert %}}

1. Type the following command into PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    .\Cortex.Innovation.Install.Gateway.ps1
    ```

1. Please read the End User Licence Agreement which can be found [here][Eula]. Once you agree to the terms, add the flag `-AcceptEULA` to the command entered above, e.g:

    ```powershell
    .\<CortexInnovationInstallScriptName>.ps1 -AcceptEULA
    ```

1. Run the PowerShell command to install Gateway.
    In the event of any errors, there will be an error message displayed at the end of the output with a line confirming the Error Count.
1. Once the PowerShell script execution has completed, the site will be available on `<protocol>://<host>:<port>/<webapplicationname>`, e.g. `https://localhost/gateway`.

## Preserve installation files

Ensure that the installation files are backed up or kept on the server, especially the scripts and config files that have been modified. This will make it easier to perform further actions in future, such as troubleshooting, certificate rollover, uninstallation, reinstallation and updates.
