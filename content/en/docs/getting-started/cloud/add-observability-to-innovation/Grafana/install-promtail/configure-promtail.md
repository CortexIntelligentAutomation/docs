## Configure Promtail

### Set Client URL for Grafana Loki

1. Open the `promtail-local-config.yaml` configuration file, which is located in the folder alongside the `promtail-windows-amd64.exe` file.
1. Replace the Grafana Loki `URL` template in the `clients` section with the `url` value noted down during [Set Up Grafana Loki][] steps.
   A correct URL should be similar to `https://239948:eyJrIjoiaWVjNzE4MmVjOThkNTgxMMQ5MzIyZjdlMjAyYWY4NWJjO1I1OTc4NSIsIm4iOiJUZXN0S2V5IiwiaWQiOjY4Nzk0MX0=@logs-prod-008.grafana.net/api/prom/push`.
1. Save the file.

### Set the positions.yaml File Path

1. Open the `promtail-local-config.yaml` configuration file, which is located in the folder alongside the `promtail-windows-amd64.exe` file.
1. Set the `filename` in the `positions` section to the location where you want the `positions.yaml` file to be created on Promtail startup.
1. Create all the folders of the path specified in the previous step.
1. Save the file.
