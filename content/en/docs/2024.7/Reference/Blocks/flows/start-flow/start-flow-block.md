The block has no block specific properties, but it does have the `Description` property that is common to all blocks. This allows users to give each block a description; typically this will be left blank for this block.

A breakpoint can be added to this block when debugging.

## Examples

## Properties

No properties for the block, other than the `Description` property that is common to all blocks.
