## Description

This block represents a new workspace; when a flow execution reaches this block it will move to the [Start Workspace][] block within this block's workspace; each workspace has its own [scope][WorkspaceScope].

The [Workspace][] block can be used to organise block logic into smaller steps with distinct functions. When a new [Workspace][] block is placed on a flow, it will contain a [Start Workspace][] and [End Workspace][] block within its workspace.

If a [Workspace][] block is copied and pasted its workspace is also copied, along with all blocks and variables within its [scope][WorkspaceScope].

The block has no block specific properties, but it does have the `Description` property that is common to all blocks. This allows users to give each block a description; typically this will be left blank for this block. Any description given will become the name for this block's [scope][WorkspaceScope]

A breakpoint can be added to this block when debugging.

## Examples

No examples for the block.

## Properties

No properties for the block, other than the `Description` property that is common to all blocks, and the `Block Timeout` property that is common to most blocks.

## Exceptions

No exceptions are thrown by the block.

## Remarks

### Block Restrictions

A workspace can contain any number of blocks. The only restrictions within a workspace are that there can only be one [Start Workspace][] block and one [Handle Workspace Exception][] block within a workspace.

Starting a flow that contains more than one of the restricted blocks within a workspace will cause a [Validation Error][Validation Errors] to occur.

### Unhandled Exceptions

If an exception thrown by a block is not handled by any connected [Handle Block Exception blocks][], it will be passed to the [Handle Workspace Exception][] block on the same workspace.

If the workspace does not contain a [Handle Workspace Exception][] block it will be rethrown by the [Workspace][] block the workspace belongs to.

This process repeats until:

* The exception is handled, or
* The exception reaches the flow's top-level workspace, is not handled by any [Handle Block Exception blocks][] and the top-level workspace does not contain a [Handle Workspace Exception][] block. At this stage, the exception is handled by the flow's [Handle Flow Exception][] block.

If an exception occurs within the workspace of the [Handle Flow Exception][] block and is not handled, the flow will end with a status of Error.

For more information about chaining of exception handling blocks and passing of exceptions, please see [Exception Handling][].

### Workspace Scope

Each workspace has its own scope; as a result, variables can be defined that only exist and are accessible in this workspace and any of its sub-workspaces. On exiting a workspace any variables defined for the workspace's scope are deleted.

For information about variables and scope, please see [Variables][].
