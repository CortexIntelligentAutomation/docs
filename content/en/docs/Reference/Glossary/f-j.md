Terms, words and phrases beginning with the letters F through J.

## F

### File

A file is an object on a computer that stores data.

Different files can store different types of data (i.e. a text file, `.txt`, stores textual data; an executable file, `.exe` stores data required for executing an application).

### Flow

A flow is an object in [Cortex Studio][TODO] that contains the logic and actions (in the form of [blocks][TODO]) that the [Cortex Evolution][TODO] [platform][TODO] is able to execute for the [flow developers][TODO].

For more detailed information about flows, see [Guides->Cortex Studio->Flows][TODO].

### Flow Developer

A flow developer is a user that has been granted permissions to develop [flows][TODO] in [Cortex Studio][TODO].

For more detailed information about granting permissions to develop [flows][TODO], see [Guides->Cortex Gateway->Authorisation][TODO].

### Folder

A folder (or directory) is an object on a computer that contains [files][TODO].

Folders can contain different types of file and can also contain other folders.

### IDE

IDE or Integrated Development Environment is a software application such as [Cortex Studio][TODO], that allows users to create a program or application.

In [Cortex Studio][TODO], the users are called [flow developers][TODO], and the programs are called [flows][TODO].

Some common and popular examples of IDE's include:

* [Visual Studio][TODO]
* [VSCode][TODO]
* [Eclipse][TODO]

### Immutable

Unable to be changed.

### Implicit Cast

The process of an application converting one [data type][TODO] to another, without requiring an explicit instruction from the developer.

For one [data type][TODO] to be able to be implicitly cast to another, there should be no data loss during the conversion.

An example would be converting a [16-bit][TODO] [integer][TODO] ([Int16][TODO]) to a [32-bit][TODO] [integer][TODO] ([Int32][TODO]), as the entire range of the 16-bit integer will fit into a 32-bit integer:

```csharp
Int16 SixteenBitInteger = 100;
Int32 ThirtyTwoBitInteger = SixteenBitInteger;
```

See [Explicit Cast][TODO] for an example of where data loss would occur during conversion, and would therefore require an explicit instruction from the developer.

See [Casting and type conversions (C# Programming Guide)][TODO] for a detailed technical explanation of casting in [C#][TODO], the [programming language][TODO] natively supported by the [Cortex Evolution][TODO] [platform][TODO] for writing simple [expressions][TODO] and more complex [code][TODO].

### Invariant Culture

A culture associated with the English language, but not with any country or region; it determines the default format for dates, times, numbers, currency values, the sorting order of text, casing conventions, and string comparisons.

It has a stable and unchanging set of rules that cannot be customized and is unaffected by culture related changes to the operating system.
