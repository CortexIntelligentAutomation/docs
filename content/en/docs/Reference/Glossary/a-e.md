### Agility

TODO: Probably remove

### API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of functions that allows applications to access data from and interact with external systems, services or applications.

### Automate

The application of [automation].

### Automation

Automation is a term for techniques, methods, systems or technologies that reduce human intervention in [tasks] and [processes].

### Automation Lifecyle

TODO: Probably remove

## B

### Bit

A bit is the most basic unit of information in computing, and represents a logical state with one of two possible values; most commonly represented as 1 or 0.

See [Wikipedia][Bit (Wikipedia)] for more information.

### Block

Blocks (or [functional blocks]) expose the logic and actions that the [Cortex] [platform] is able to execute for the [flow developers]; alongside [flows][flow] they are one of the main components used to define how to automate [tasks] and [processes].

For more detailed information about blocks, see [Guides->Cortex Studio->Blocks][TODO].

For a complete list of available blocks deployed with the platform, see [Reference->Blocks].

### Block Property

[Blocks][Block] have block properties (or [properties]) that allow the [flow developers] to configure how the block should behave; e.g. a block to send emails would have properties for specifying things like the sender, recipients, summary, body, attachments etc.

For more detailed information about configuring blocks using block properties, see [Guides->Cortex Studio->Blocks->Configuring Blocks][TODO].

### Byte

A byte is a unit of information in computing that most commonly consists of eight [bits][Bit].

See [Wikipedia][Byte (Wikipedia)] for more information.

## C

### C\#

C# (pronounced "see sharp") is a [programming language] developed by Microsoft.

It is natively supported by the [Cortex] [platform] for using simple [expressions][expression] (i.e. `1 + 1`) and more complex [code] (i.e. `DateTime.Now.AddDays(1)`) within [flows][flow].

C# expressions and code can be entered as the values for [block properties][Block Property] using the [Cortex Studio] [expression editor].

See the official [C# documentation] for more information about C#.

### camelCase

camelCase is a typographical convention in which phrases are written without spaces or punctuation, indicating the separation of words with a single capitalized letter, and the first word starting with a lowercase letter. E.g. "iPhone" and "eBay".

camelCase is often used as a naming convention in programming languages such as [C#].

See also [PascalCase].

### Case-insensitive

If something is case-insensitive, it means it ignores differences in case (i.e. `CASE` is considered equal to `case`).

### Case-sensitive

If something is case-sensitive, it means it considers differences in case (i.e. `CASE` is considered not equal to `case`).

### Cast

The process of explicitly converting one [data type] to another.

See [Casting and type conversions (C# Programming Guide)] for a detailed technical explanation of casting in [C#], the [programming language] natively supported by the [Cortex] [platform] for writing simple [expressions][expression] and more complex [code].

Also see [Explicit Cast] for more information.

### Cloud

A global network of servers which are linked together and operate as a single ecosystem.

Examples of publically available Cloud providers include:

* Amazon AWS
* Google Cloud Platform
* Microsoft Azure

### Code

A set of instructions in a computer program.

### Concurrent

At the same time.

### Convert

To change something into a different form. E.g. Change some [text] from [lowercase] to [UPPERCASE].

### Cortex

The name of the new and current generation of the Cortex [automation] [platform].

### Cortex Gateway

The centralised web-based [portal] for accessing all user applications and tooling in the [Cortex] [platform].

### Cortex Studio

The web-based integrated development environment ([IDE]) for creating, editing, [debugging], testing and managing [flows][flow] that define the logic and actions required to capture and automate a [task][Tasks] or [process][Processes].

For more detailed information about Cortex Studio, see [Guides->Cortex Studio][TODO].

### Culture

Describes a set of rules for data that differs between different cultures; it determines the default format for dates, times, numbers, currency values, the sorting order of text, casing conventions, and text comparisons.

TODO: In .Net details about culture are represented by the cultureinfo data type...https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo?view=net-5.0

### Culture identifier

A culture identifier is a standard international numeric abbreviation and has the components necessary to uniquely identify one of the operating system's installed cultures.

TODO: For more information about culture identifiers see...https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo?view=net-5.0#culture-names-and-identifiers

### Culture-insensitive

If something is culture-insensitive, it means that it does not get affected by culture related changes to the operating system, such as language and regional settings.

### Culture-sensitive

If something is culture-sensitive, it means that it does get affected by culture related changes to the operating system, such as language and regional settings.

### Current Culture

The current culture used by the executing thread; it determines the default format for dates, times, numbers, currency values, the sorting order of text, casing conventions, and string comparisons.

TODO: In .Net details about the current culture are represented by the cultureinfo data type...https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentculture?view=net-5.0

## D

### Data Type

A data type (or [type]) defines the type of data or values that a [block property] can accept.

For more detailed information about data types, see [Reference->Data Types].

### Debug

The ability for [flow developers] to execute and interact with a [flow] step-by-step from within [Cortex Studio], so that they are able to identify and remove [errors] in the [flow's][flow] logic and actions.

For more detailed information about debugging in Cortex Studio, see [Guides->Cortex Studio->Debugging][TODO].

### Default Value

The default that is assigned as the value of a [block property] when a new [block] is added to a [flow].

### Deploy

TODO

### Deployment

TODO

### Design Sprint

TODO add link to urls.toml

See https://resources.cortex-ia.com/download-cortex-intelligent-automation-design-sprint

### Diagnostics

TODO Probably remove

### Dictionary

A [data type] that represents an unordered collection of key-item pairs, where each pair consists of a unique key and its associated item. Dictionaries are optimised for fast lookup of items using their key.

For more detailed information about dictionaries, see [Reference->Data Types->Dictionaries][TODO].

### Digital Transformation

TODO

### dynamic

A [data type] that indicates that any data type can be used.

For more detailed information about the dynamic data type, see [Reference->Data Types->dynamic][TODO].

## E

### Efficiency

TODO Probably remove

### Empty

Empty indicates that a [data type] has been [initialised] and has a [non-null] value, but the value does not contain any data. E.g. a [string] that contains no characters `""`, or a [list] that contains no items `[]`.

Empty is not the same as [null].

### Enterprise-grade

TODO

### Error

Something which is inaccurate or incorrect; a mistake.

### Example

An example is intended to show [flow developers] how something works. Examples can be found near the top of every [block's][block] help page. See [examples] for the [Add Text At Beginning] block.

### Exception

An exception represents [errors] that occur during the [execution] of a [flow].

Exceptions are [data types][Data Type] that can be reasoned with during the execution of a flow, in order to handle errors during the [automation] of a [task][Tasks] or [process][Processes].

For a complete list of available [blocks][block] that can be used to handle exceptions, see [Exception Blocks].

For more detailed information about exceptions, see [Reference->Exceptions].

### Execution

When a [request] to start a [flow] is received by the [Cortex] [platform], an execution is created that represents that instance of the executing flow.

There can be multiple executions of a flow running [concurrently][concurrent].

For more detailed information about executions, see [Guides->Cortex Studio->Debugging->Executions][TODO].

### Explicit Cast

Sometimes, in order to convert one [data type] to another, an "explicit cast" [expression] is required; this is typically needed when information might be lost in the conversion, or when the conversion might not succeed for other reasons.

An example would be converting a [32-bit] [integer] ([Int32]) to a [16-bit] [integer] ([Int16]):

```csharp
Int32 ThirtyTwoBitInteger = 100;
Int16 SixteenBitInteger = (Int16)ThirtyTwoBitInteger;
```

See [Cast expression (C# Reference)] for a detailed technical explanation.

Also see [Cast] for more information.

### Expression

An expression is a combination of [operands] (i.e. [variables], [literals], calls to [methods] and [properties][PropertiesC#] exposed on [data types][Data Type] etc.) and [operators] (i.e. =, +, -, *, / etc.) that can be evaluated by the [Cortex] [platform] to a single value.

Expressions use the syntax of the [C#] [programming language].

For more detailed information about expressions, see [Guides->Cortex Studio->Expressions][TODO].

### Expression Editor

The Expression Editor is a web-based text editor that allows [flow developers] to use either simple [expression] or more complex [code] as the value of a [block property].

It is based on the [Monaco Editor] used by [VS Code], and includes a rich set of features including:

* [Syntax Highlighting][TODO]
* [Snippets][TODO]
* [Intellisense][TODO]

For more detailed information about the Expression Editor, see [Guides->Cortex Studio->Expression Editor][TODO].
