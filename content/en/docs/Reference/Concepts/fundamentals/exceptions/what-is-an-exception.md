## Summary

An Exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a [flow][Flows] that disrupts the standard process of the [flow][Flows] execution.

Exceptions can be caused by:

- Misconfiguration in a block
- Unexpected responses from a third-party system
- Environmental issues
- Intentionally [Throwing Exceptions][]

Exceptions (sometimes referred to as Errors) can be handled in different ways depending on where the exception occurred. See [Handling Exceptions][] for more detail on how to handle exceptions.

## Anatomy of an Exception

### Common Properties

| Property | Notes | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Exception Type | The type of exception | `InvalidPropertyValueException`
| Exception Message | The Exception Message contains relevant information to the exception. This typically includes the cause of the exception, possible resolutions, and any related information. The exact message depends on the Exception being raised. See [Exceptions][Exception] for reference information on different Exceptions that can be raised during flow executions | `The value of the property could not be evaluated.`
| Inner Exception | Contains the exception that caused this exception, if any | `"Exception Type":"KeyNotFoundException","Message":"The given key 'Datetime' was not present in the dictionary."`|
| Help Link | Help link to aid with troubleshooting and resolution for the exception. There are three types of help links:</br></br><ul><li>**Cortex** help links direct to material within the Cortex Product Portal. This documentation is written and maintained by Cortex and contains information directly related to the Cortex product.</li><li>**External** help links direct to externally hosted material about the exception. This documentation is not written or maintained by Cortex.</li><li>**Custom** help links are generated by flow developers during the design and development of flows. These help links are configured in the [Throw New Exception][] block, and can link to any resource applicable to the exception.</li></ul> | `https://v2022.docs.cortex-ia.com/docs/reference/exceptions/flows/blocks/invalid-property-value-exception` |

### Additional Properties

Depending on the exception, additional properties may be present. Typically, these can include **Category**, **Error Code**, **Details**.

## Remarks

### Known Limitations

#### Carriage Return and Line Feed Characters

Carriage Return and Line Feed characters within an exception are supported but will be displayed as `\r`, `\n`, or `\r\n`.

#### Copying Exception Text

The [Exception Viewer][] currently does not support traditional copy functionality. A workaround is to highlight the text, then click and drag into another text editor.
