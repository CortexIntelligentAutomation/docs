## Summary

Custom exceptions can be intentionally generated as part of the [flow's][Flow] logic, using the [Throw Exception][Block-Throw-Exception] [block][What-Is-Block].

Custom exceptions are usually generated by the [Throw Exception][Block-Throw-Exception] block after a [Handle Block Exception][Block-Handle-Block-Exception] block or [Handle Workspace Exception][Block-Handle-Workspace-Exception] block has been triggered by an exception, typically from an external request to a third-party system or the [Run Flow][TODO Run Flow block] block.
