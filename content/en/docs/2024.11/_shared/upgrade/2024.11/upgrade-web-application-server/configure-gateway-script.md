    | Name                                           | Description |
    |------------------------------------------------|-------------|
    |`GatewayPackagePath`                            | Configure this value with the location of the `Cortex Innovation 2024.11 - Gateway.zip` file on the server. |
    |`GatewayApplicationPoolUsername`                | Replace `Domain\Username` with the user that is used to run the {{% ctx %}} Gateway application pool currently.|
    |`WebRootFolder`                                 | Replace this with the correct path for the Web Root Folder on the server. Typically this will be  `C:\inetpub\wwwroot`.|
    |`WebsitePort`                                   | Replace this with the port that you wish the website to use. Typically this will be `443`.|
    |`ImportCertificate`                             | This should be set to `$false`.|
    |`CertificateFriendlyName`                       | Replace this with the friendly name that is allocated to the certificate that {{% ctx %}} Gateway is currently using.|
    |`ConfigureSiteRedirect`                         | If the site hosting the {{% ctx %}} Gateway web application is an existing site that doesnâ€™t have its own content, it is recommended to redirect the site URL to the {{% ctx %}} Gateway web application URL. The default behaviour of the script is to create a URL Rewrite redirect rule to achieve this.<br /><br />To skip this rule creation change the value to `$false`.|
    |`ApplySecurityMeasures`                         | Change this to `$false` if you do not require the latest recommended [Security Best Practices][] to be implemented as part of the installation process.|
    |`UsingWindowsDefender`                          | Change this to `$false` if you are not using the Windows Defender firewall.<br /><br />If Windows Defender is not being used but an alternative firewall is, it must be configured to allow communication inbound via TCP on the port configured for HTTPS (usually 443).|
    |`AcceptEULA`                                    | This does not need to be changed, the EULA will be accepted at a later stage. |
    |`FilePath`                                      | The filename that installation logs are written to.  If this should be written to a different location than where the installation files are then a full path should be specified. |

1. Save and close `Cortex.Innovation.Install.Gateway.ps1`.
