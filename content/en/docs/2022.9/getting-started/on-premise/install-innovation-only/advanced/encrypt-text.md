To encrypt text using the Cortex Encryptor PowerShell module:

1. Extract the `Cortex Innovation 2022.9 - Encryptor.zip` file to a folder with the same name.
1. Open a Windows PowerShell (x64) window as administrator.
1. Navigate PowerShell to inside the `Cortex Innovation 2022.9 - Encryptor` folder using the following command, modifying the path as necessary:

    ```powershell
    cd "C:\Install\Cortex Innovation 2022.9 - Encryptor"
    ```

1. In the Windows PowerShell (x64) window, run the following command to import the module:

    ```powershell
    Import-Module .\Cortex.Encryptor.psd1
    ```

1. In the Windows PowerShell (x64) window, run the following command to encrypt text, replacing `text to encrypt` with the text that you want to encrypt:

    ```powershell
    ConvertTo-EncryptedText -Text "text to encrypt"
    ```

    The command will return the encrypted text, beginning with `#_`. This step can be repeated for any texts that need to be encrypted.

    {{< alert title="Note:" >}}The `Import-Module` command will need to be repeated every time a new PowerShell window is used. To install the PowerShell module so that it is always available, follow the instructions laid out {{< ahref "MSDocs.PowerShell.InstallModule" "here" >}}.{{< /alert >}}
