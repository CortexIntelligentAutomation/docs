## Summary

The Executions Grid displays information about all the [flows][What is a Flow?] that are currently being debugged by the developer.

## Anatomy

{{< figure src="/images/Flow Editor - Executions Grid.png" title="Executions Grid" >}}

The Executions Grid is automatically displayed when in `Debug` mode and a flow is `Running` or `Paused`; however, it may be manually opened, or closed any time by clicking the Open/Close handle or resized by dragging the handle up or down.

Flows that are `Running` or `Paused` are shown with a green background; flows that have raised an [exception][What is an Exception?] are shown with a red background.

## Actions

### Select an Execution

An [execution][What is an Execution?] may be selected by clicking on its row and can be controlled by action icons at the top right of the Executions Grid. Multiple executions can be selected using `Ctrl + Click` or `Shift + Click`. Selected executions are indicated with a darker background and the actions available are dependent on the state of the selected executions; greyed-out action icons are not applicable to the selected executionsâ€™ state.

### Continue the Execution

Clicking the {{< image src="/images/Flow Editor - Continue Execution.png" >}} icon causes the selected executions to continue until the flow ends, a breakpoint is reached, or [`Break on exception`][Execution Options] is enabled and an exception has occurred causing the flow to pause. This action is only available for paused executions.

See the [Continue and Stop the Execution][Continue and Stop the Execution tutorial] tutorial for a step-by-step guide.

### Pause the Execution

Clicking the {{< image src="/images/Flow Editor - Pause Execution.png" >}} icon pauses the selected executions. This action is only available for running executions.

### Step the Execution

Clicking the {{< image src="/images/Flow Editor - Step Execution.png" >}} icon causes the selected executions to execute the next [block][What is a Block?] and pause again. This action is only available for paused executions.

See the [Step the Execution][Step the Execution tutorial] tutorial for a step-by-step guide.

### Stop the Execution

Clicking the {{< image src="/images/Flow Editor - Stop Execution.png" >}} icon stops the selected executions, and after a few seconds, removes them from Executions Grid. This action is available for all executions, regardless of their state.

See the [Continue and Stop the Execution][Continue and Stop the Execution tutorial] tutorial for a step-by-step guide.

### Go To

Clicking the {{< image src="/images/Flow Editor - Go To.png" >}} icon causes the Flow Editor to open the [workspace][What is a Workspace?] which the selected execution is executing and focus on the location of the execution. It is typically used to locate the selected execution when the execution is not automatically tracked. This action is available for all executions, regardless of their state.

See the [Stop Tracking and Go To][Stop Tracking and Go To tutorial] tutorial for a step-by-step guide.

### Start Tracking

Clicking the {{< image src="/images/Flow Editor - Start Tracking.png" >}} icon causes the Flow Editor to follow the selected execution, opening any necessary workspaces. This action is available for any execution not being tracked.

Note: When an execution is started, if no other executions are being tracked, it will be automatically tracked if [`Show execution on workspace`][Execution Options] is enabled.

See the [Start Tracking][Start Tracking tutorial] tutorial for a step-by-step guide.

### Stop Tracking

Clicking the {{< image src="/images/Flow Editor - Stop Tracking.png" >}} icon causes the tracking of the execution to stop, and the Flow Editor will not follow the selected execution. This action is available for any execution being tracked.

See the [Stop Tracking and Go To][Stop Tracking and Go To tutorial] tutorial for a step-by-step guide.

### Show Initial Flow First / Show Initial Flow Last

Clicking the {{< image src="/images/Flow Editor - Show First.png" >}} (Show Initial Flow First) or {{< image src="/images/Flow Editor - Show Last.png" >}} (Show Initial Flow Last) icon changes the order of the hierarchy of parent and child flow executions, placing the parent execution uppermost and its children below, or the child execution uppermost and it's parent below. When {{< image src="/images/Flow Editor - Show First.png" >}} is clicked the icon changes to {{< image src="/images/Flow Editor - Show Last.png" >}} and vice versa. This action applies to all executions in the Executions Grid.

See the [Show Initial Flow First or Last][Show Initial Flow First or Last tutorial] tutorial for a step-by-step guide.
