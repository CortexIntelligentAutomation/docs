## Summary

TODO

- Summary
- What is an Occurrence?
- How are they accessed?
  - Positive or Negative int properties on blocks that operate on single items
- Difference between occurrence and indexes

## Positive Occurrences

TODO:

- Get First, Second, Third, Nth

## Negative Occurrences

- Get Last, Second from Last, Third from Last, Nth from Last

## Remarks

### Occurrence Not Present

TODO:

Blocks will either throw an exception if the occurrence is not present (e.g. OccurrenceNotPresentException), or they will handle the occurrence not being present either by performing no operation or by returning a predetermined value.

For example:

- Get Index Of Item With Value (returns predetermined value)
- Remove Item With Value (no operation performed)
- Get Item With Key (throws OccurrenceNotPresentException)
