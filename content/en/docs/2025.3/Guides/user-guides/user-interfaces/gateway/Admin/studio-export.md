## Actions

### Export Flows

Individual flows are selected by clicking the checkbox in the `Export?` column adjacent to the flow to be exported. If a group is selected, then all the flows contained in that group, and any sub-groups, will be implicitly set; any implicitly set may be individually deselected by clicking the checkbox adjacent to the flow.

Clicking `Export` checks if selected flows have dependencies. If there are dependencies, an additional page will be shown to allow confirmation that these should be included in the export. By default these are selected but can be deselected. A Studio Package will then be created from the Master Versions in the Master Repository of the selected flows, including their group hierarchy. The package will then be downloaded to the hostâ€™s browser as a file named `export.studiopkg` or `export <n>.studiopkg`, where `<n>` represents an integer to avoid naming conflict with other Studio Package files contained in the same folder.

It is not necessary to have View or Edit authorisation for the flows to be exported.

See the [Export Individual Flows][Export Individual Flows tutorial] tutorial for a step-by-step guide.
