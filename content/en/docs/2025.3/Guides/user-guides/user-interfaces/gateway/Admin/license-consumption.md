## Summary

The License Consumption page is used to view the license consumption for the current platform and the minimum license requirement to support the current usage.

## Anatomy

{{< figure src="/images/License Consumption.png" title="License Consumption" >}}

## Actions

### View License Consumption

Every functional block connected to a Start Flow block adds one to the license consumption, except for the following blocks, which do not impact the license consumption:

* [Start Flow][]
* [End Flow][]
* [Start Workspace][]
* [End Workspace][]
* [Wireless Receiver][]
* [Wireless Sender][]
* [Workspace][]
* [Handle Flow Exception Workspace][]

The License Consumption details are shown in a tabular format, where each flowâ€™s license consumption is aggregated and shown as a total against its parent group. Groups may be expanded to show the license consumption of each individual flow.

The `Breakdown` switch expands the table to additionally show the flow usage and the number of functional blocks used in each flow. In {{% ctx %}} all flows will have a count of 1 in the `Usage` column.

See the [Check License Consumption][Check License Consumption tutorial] tutorial for a step-by-step guide.
